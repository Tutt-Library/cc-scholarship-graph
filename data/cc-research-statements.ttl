Meanwhile, Ofer traveled to attend concert and recordings of his music in several European cities: first to Budapest, Hungary where the “Odessa Trio” was performed and professionally recorded. The next stop was the St. Vlas Music Festival in Bulgaria where the “Klezmer Concerto” was performed by the Burgas Symphony Orchestra with the renowned clarinetist Rossen Idealov. 2015-16 was an excellent year for his “Odessa Trio”: after the summer performances in Hungary and Germany, the work received numerous performance by various ensembles in the U.S: Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, Colorado College, St. Paul, Minnesota, and New York City at the prestigious North/South Consonance Series. In October, the duo Quattro Mani (Susan Grace and Steven Beck) premiered a new two-piano work “Tango de viaje” and professionally recorded it for the Bridge recording label. “Tango de viaje” got a second performance later in the year when CC collaborated with UCCS in an extensive new music concert. In November, Ofer was invited to receive the first prize at the Smareglia International Competition in Udine, Italy. The highlight of the year was the production of “The Dybbuk” a chamber opera in three acts, in Big Sky, Montana. The international team of performance was directed by CC Professor Thomas Lindblade. The production was generously supported by the Dean’s Office as well as a SEGway grant. In April, the Music Department performed a concert to commemorate the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Ofer’s piano arrangement of R. Yardumian’s “Armenian Suite” opened the program with a performance by CC’s pianist Susan Grace. In addition to the creative work, Ofer gave a lecture on the subject of J.S. Bach to the PILLAR Institute of Lifelong Learning and conducted a master class on music composition at Metro State University in Denver. In April, the Chamber Orchestra of the Springs twice performed the “Concertino - From Darkness to Light” for clarinet, guitar, and orchestra as part of their last concert of the season. Finally, in May, Ofer attended the Rimon Artist Salon in St Paul, Minnesota, for an event titled, “Copyright or Birthright: Performing the Music of Ofer Ben-Amots.” "@en ;

Barrie’s “Peter and Wendy, Nothing But A Man” (1960), “The Silence of the Lambs,” Disney’s “Peter Pan,” the Coen Brothers’ “Raising Arizona,” with an epilogue on Jeanette Winterson’s “Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?,” and Marc Webb’s “(500) Days of Summer.” His next project focuses on narrative medicine, as he develops a new course, Introduction to Narrative Medicine.

    schema:description "Tracy is a scholar of Hinduism and its traditions of bhakti (devotion), especially Krishna-bhakti in the Sanskrit epics and purāṇas, and her teaching and research address issues of women, men, and gender in religion and society. Her current book manuscript — a study of Krishna’s relationships with women in the Hariva ṃśa, the Vi ṣṇu Purāṇa, and the Bhāgavata Purā ṇa -- reconsiders the prevalent claim that bhakti empowers women in social and religious life. Her study demonstrates to the contrary that despite the democratic potential of various devotional movements in which women are sometimes glorified, bhakti often functions as a conservative historical process upholding the traditional patriarchal order. By situating the development of bhakti within a larger cultural discourse on dharma (truth, duty, proper behavior), the book explores Krishna’s sensuous relationships with women in contrast to the Buddha’s ascetic renunciation of familial attachments and thus shows how competing conceptions of dharma were linked to heroic male figures as embodiments of truth and authority in socio-religious life. The eventual book will thereby provide a brief comparative history of gender and salvation in South Asian religions and offer a new interpretation of bhakti that holds relevance for the study of religion and social change in other cultures.

She works on fundamental philosophical research, applied to important issues of our day. For example, she has published work on the application of philosophical theories of vagueness to the practical problem of categorization by sex and gender. The fundamental question there is how to reason logically, using vague categories, but the problem has special urgency in its application to sex and gender. Categorization by sex and/or gender is particularly fraught and so demands particular care; Helen’s approach to the logic of vague categories provides a sensible path forward. She has also recently been engaged in the question of whether eternal damnation is consistent with other tenets of Christianity — an especially important application of metaphysics for many people. Helen’s newest research project is to develop an account of insults that explains how they function as part of human communication, broadly construed. It is a practical application of her novel approach to the study of pragmatics, grounded in Paul Grice’s conversational implicatures. Her hope is that a deeper understanding of insults will lead to better communication and thereby a more civil society. "@en ;

    schema:description "Peggy is a physical biochemist who uses thermodynamics to investigate how chemistry gives rise to function in biological systems. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is of interest to scientists due to its ability to utilize a diverse set of nutrients as a source of carbon and nitrogen, and to its high level of competence with regards to natural transformation. Recent findings showed that A. baylyi ADP1 survives starvation induced conditions during long term stationary phase through upregulation of thirty genes, approximately 25% of which are denoted conserved hypothetical genes. Conserved hypothetical genes are those that have been identified through genetic analysis, but have not had a protein product identified. Subsequently, a number of associated genes are encoded in an operon, suggesting that they work together to confer resistance to starvation conditions. The goal of Peggy’s lab is to clone these genes and characterize their biological function. Her lab is initially focusing on genes that have been identified by bioinformatics to encode for enzymes with testable functions. Bioinformatic approaches identified genes that potentially encode for a cysteine protease (gene ACIAD1960), and a triad of genes that occur together which encode a kinase (gene ACIAD1964), and a phosphatase (gene ACIAD1965) and a protein of unknown function (gene ACIAD1966). They have confirmed that gene ACIAD1960, does indeed encode a cysteine protease (4). Specifically, they plan to: (1). Characterize the gene product for ACIAD1960, the cysteine protease, StiP. They will characterize the solution conditions that contribute to maximal activity, including pH, ionic strength, metal ion dependence and contribution of reducing agents. (2). Clone and characterize the gene product for ACIAD1964. They will test the hypothesis that the protein that is encoded by this gene is a kinase, as has been indicated by bioinformatics approaches.(3). Clone and characterize the gene product for ACIAD1965. They will test the hypothesis that the protein that is encoded by this gene is a phosphatase, as has been indicated by bioinformatics approaches. (4). Clone and characterize the gene product for ACIAD1966. They will test the hypothesis that the protein that is encoded by this gene forms a multimeric complex with the gene products of ACIAD1964 and ACIAD1965. "@en ;

Her article, “‘On Being Young— A Woman — and Coloured’ in Paris and Tangiers: A Geocritical Approach to Mapping Anita Thompson Dickinson Reynolds’ Modernism” is forthcoming in Palimpsest: A Journal on Women, Gender, and the Black International. Her article, “Black Women Writers, Modernism, and Paris,” was published in a special edition of The International Journal of Francophone Studies, Last year, her paper on black women students in Paris was selected as one of a dozen chosen from over 70 submissions for presentation at the Black Paris Seminar at the American Comparative Literature Association conference. She has presented papers at the Collegium for African American research in Liverpool and Paris and the Afro-Modernisms 1 and 2 Conferences in Liverpool. Her recent presentations focus on both anglophone and francophone feminist writers such as the Nardal sisters of Martinique, Harlem Renaissance luminary Jessie Fauset, and the adventurer Anita Thompson Dickinson Reynolds. She continues work on her book project, “They Have Discovered the Relativity of All Things’: Black Women Writers in Paris 1900-1960.” Her research has taken her to archives and libraries in Aix-en-Provence, Paris, Washington, D.C., Martinique, New Haven, London, and New York. Thanks to generous grants from Feminist and Gender Studies and the English Department, Claire finished up her research in Martinique in May. She spent much of the summer in Paris working in the Sénat Archives and the BnF and writing. Claire hasn’t completely abandoned her identity as a scholar of Henry James. She contributed a chapter called, “Citizens of Babylon: Henry James’s Modern Parisian Women” to the volume “Henry James’s Europe: Heritage and Transfers” (Open University Press 2011). Claire has also become interested in more contemporary issues of class, race, and gender. A conference paper, “Black Bourgeois Women’s Narratives in the Post-Reagan, ‘Post-Civil Rights’, ‘Post-Feminist’ Era” is now a chapter in “From Bourgeois to Boojie: Black Middle-Class Performances” (Wayne State University Press 2010). Claire continues to assemble an anthology of Jessie Fauset’s work with Fauset scholar Carolyn Wedin.  She does a lot of presentations on her research at other colleges and universities in the area, and has done several keynote speeches around the state on issues relating to education, race, gender, ethnic studies, and citizenship.

    schema:description "A Grammy-nominated pianist, Susan has performed solo and chamber recitals, and has appeared as soloist with orchestras in the United States, Europe, the former Soviet Union, Korea, India, and China. She has, in addition, performed in numerous series and festivals, including the Aspekte Festival in Salzburg, St Paul Chamber Orchestra’s new-music series Engine 408, Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., the Grand Teton Festival, the Cape Cod Music Festival, Festival Mozaic, Music at Oxford, and the Helmsley Festival in England. She is a member of Quattro Mani, an internationally acclaimed two-piano ensemble that made its New York debut in January 2001 in Carnegie Recital Hall to a sold-out hall. They were immediately re-engaged for four more seasons. Their special interest in 20th and 21st century repertoire has led to collaborations with such composers as George Crumb, Joan Tower, and Frederic Rzewski and to participation in contemporary music festivals throughout the U.S. and Europe. Following the release of Quattro Mani’s debut CD, “A Game of Go,” Fanfare wrote: “Grace and Rybak play all of this music with power and intelligence, shaping large expressive phrases. Quattro Mani’s blistering performance forms the beating heart of an arresting recital.” Quattro Mani’s next CD - a recording of George Crumb’s music for two pianos - was issued by Bridge Records and immediately nominated as “Best Chamber Music CD of the Year” by the International Critics Committee of the Cannes Classic Awards. This CD received Fanfare’s ‘Critics Choice’ and highest ratings from France’s Repertoire as well as from ClassicsToday.com. Speaking about Quattro Mani, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Crumb writes: “The duo piano team Quattro Mani is one of the very finest I have heard. Susan Grace and Alice Rybak are wonderful artists and their performances are both technically and musically superb.” Quattro Mani has been featured on three recent critically acclaimed discs: “Harmony for a New World,” (INNOVA 603), “The Music of Poul Ruders Vol. 4,” (BRIDGE 9143) and “Complete Crumb Edition Vol. 8,” (BRIDGE 9155) which was chosen as one of the top 10 CD’s for 2004 by Amazon.com. International Record Review said of the recording “Concertos for Two Pianos,” (BRIDGE 9224) which includes works by Poulenc, Bartok, and Milhaud “...the playing is first-class throughout; immaculate in technical terms and unfailingly musical...” Other releases by Bridge Records include a CD of music written expressly for the duo entitled “Kindred Spirits” (BRIDGE 9260), and another with works by Stefan Wolpe (BRIDGE 9308). In February 2011, the duo recorded “Shapeshifters,” a concerto written for them by Paul Lansky, with the Alabama Symphony. In May 2012, Quattro Mani performed the same piece with the Alabama Symphony in Carnegie Hall. The New York Times acknowledged the performance with “…the impressive duo, Quattro Mani…” Susan has recorded for Bridge Records, the Belgium National Radio, WFMT in Chicago, the Society of Composers, Wilson Audio, Klavier International, and Klavier Music Productions. She was nominated for a Grammy in 2005 in the Best Small Ensemble Performance category. Susan is a recipient of the 2005 Business and Community Alliance Partner award for making a significant contribution to the non-college community in Colorado Springs. In April 2009, Susan received a Pikes Peak Arts Council “Force for the Arts” award, which celebrates Colorado Springs community members who contribute to the arts in education. In September 2009, the ninth annual Pikes Peak Arts Council Awards honored her work as music director of the Colorado College Summer Music Festival with the “Vision, Courage, and Achievement Award.” Susan is associate chair, artist-in-residence, and senior lecturer in music and music director of the internationally renowned Colorado College Summer Music Festival, which is in its 29th season.

Her research addresses the connections between race, immigration, globalization, and the dancing body. She is currently working on her book manuscript, tentatively titled “On the Move: Transnational South Asian Labor and the ‘Flexible’ Dancing Body,” which chronicles the lives of transnational South Asian migrant dancers in the UK and India, and the effects of globalization on their bodily practices. In particular, it examines how race and citizenship intersect in late capitalism in often conflicting and paradoxical ways, and how dancers negotiate these contradictions through their flexible bodily labor. Her work contributes to both the field of dance studies and globalization studies by looking at the corporeal dimensions of transnational labor and ‘flexible citizenship’ (Ong 1999). Before coming to Colorado College, Anusha was a lecturer in dance studies at the University of Malta and UC-Riverside. Her research and teaching interests include Indian dance history and culture; intercultural performance; race and citizenship; and, migration, globalization, and the body. Anusha is also an established artist and choreographer in the field of classical and contemporary Indian dance. She has trained for over 30 years in Bharata Natyam and has performed and toured with several contemporary Indian dance companies in the U.S. and Britain, including Arpana, Angika, Atma, and Sadhana. Her own choreography has been presented on various international stages, including Glorya Kaufman Hall (Los Angeles), Roehampton University (London), Mediterranean Institute of Theatre and Performance (Malta), and the Purcell Room (London).

    schema:description "Genevieve’s current book project investigates the labor of physically disabled characters in early modern English theatre. “Early Modern Theatre and the Figure of Disability” shows that early modern theatrical representation relied on representations of physical disability to navigate the “likeness problems” of theatre. The first of these likeness problems is the relationship between actor and character: prosthetic disabled figures with names like Cripple and Stump capture the simultaneous presence of the imaginative world of the fiction and the material, embodied world of the theatre. The second likeness problem mediated by the bodies of early modern disabled characters is the relationship between plays in their theatrical and in their textual forms. This relationship, beginning in the period itself, has been understood in part through an appeal to disability: supposedly imperfect textual versions of plays are characterized as “lame.” Attention to physical disability enriches our understanding of early modern ideas about how theatre works; as well, theatre’s distinctiveness as a medium offers a reframing of disability as metaphor.

    schema:description "What is the surface of the smallest area spanning a given contour? The answer can be found by dipping a wire contour into soapy water and observing the resulting soap film, a physical example of minimal surface. The technical definition of a minimal surface — that at each point the mean curvature is zero — results in the area minimizing property for any contour cut from the surface. Minimizing area goes hand in hand with minimizing energy of a structure, and consequently minimal surfaces frequently appear in nature. Minimal surfaces find application in areas as diverse as architectural tensile structures (the Munich Olympic Stadium or for a local example, the Denver International Airport) and molecular engineering, and have received much attention in recent decades. In 1982, Costa discovered the first new minimal surface in over 100 years, with extraordinary complex topology. Jane’s research as a complex analyst has led her, using essentially classical techniques, to construct new minimal surfaces with “non-convex shadows” that generalize the classical Scherk surfaces. Due to their broad application and the current level of research activity, minimal surfaces form an exciting area of modern research, both pure and applied, in the new millennium. "@en ;

With respect to the former, he is engaged in a number of projects exploring racial and class disparities in blood lead levels in young children. Elevated lead levels have been linked to both cognitive and emotional outcomes in children, as well as related social outcomes throughout the life course, such as educational attainment. This research highlights the role of social factors in shaping health outcomes that ultimately inform long-standing questions about the mechanisms and processes behind the social reproduction of inequality across generations. A second body of research uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the distribution of community hazards, resources, and events to better inform our understanding of the spatial dimensions of inequality and poverty. This research is connected to his course on the spatial analysis of social issues and emerging opportunities for community-based research at Colorado College. "@en ;

This year, as part of her studies on early modern literature she was invited to give a talk on the Desengaños amorosos, a 17th century collection of novellas, at the symposium María de Zayas: New Approaches at Florida Atlantic University. This year, she has also begun new work that weaves together several of her academic interests: Baroque literature and mechanisms of deception, contemporary Spanish visual culture, and questions of national identity in 21st century Spain. Her new research explores how the theatre group Els Joglars appropriates Cervantes’s play “El retablo de las maravillas” in their 2004-05 play. She has presented this new work at two conferences: the Early Modern Text and Image Society Conference and the Rocky Mountain MLA. Also, her work on the implementation of discursive strategies by female Others as a means for social action and agency in medieval Spain has come to fruition in the publication of her article “Armas y escudos del amor: dimensiones sociales del lenguaje en el Libro de buen amor,” in Viator . Medieval and Renaissance Studies 43 (2012). Additionally, her book chapter “Pieces from the Past: Contestation around Francoist Monuments in Modern-day Spain” has been published in “Outrage! Art, Controversy, and Society.” (Eds. Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, Richard Howells, and Judith Schachter. Palgrave Macmillan P. 2012). In this study she examines the problematic issues that arise in regard to national identity, memory, and history in modern-day Spain and their relation to the visual arts. "@en ;

Recent work in Colorado and Wyoming related to the development of Laramide Mountains, through faulting and deformation. Previous work focused on the growth of the continent, through magmatism, tectonic accretion, and plutonism, in Precambrian time. In Antarctica, Christine has 11 seasons’ experience carrying out geological research supported by vessel in coastal regions and out of self-supported camps in remote on-continent locations. In addition to her own National Science Foundation-funded research, she has participated in Italian and German expeditions, for work in locales along the entire Pacific margin of Antarctica. The Antarctic research has been complemented by work in New Zealand, on rocks that correlate to West Antarctica. Presently she is involving CC students with Antarctic research through a “virtual geology” approach to mapping of the structures of West Antarctica using GIS and high resolution satellite imagery. Since field access is so restricted, this allows many more students to “travel” to Antarctica via computer, using facilities in the W.H. Keck GIS Commons at CC!  Coming up in 2017-18, Christine has been invited to participate in the ANDRILL-Coulman High drilling project that will recover sediment records from a bathymetric high in the Ross Sea. "@en ;

Recent publications include an article in French Forum on the homosocial bonds between men in 19th-century France and their mimetic desire for the courtesan, as well as several articles adapted from the work of her monograph, “Fictions of Pleasure: The Putain Memoirs of Eighteenth-Century France,” exploring constructions of power, gender, and utopic fantasy in the libertine novel as a means of undermining the social iniquities of the Ancien régime. Future projects include an essay on French microgenres in the long 18th century and a study on the dissemination of Newton’s laws of gravity and attraction through literary texts. "@en ;

These orchids occur as epiphytes in high-elevation cloud forests from southern Mexico, through Central America, into the Andean countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Through field work and collaborations with individuals and botanic gardens in each of these locations, Mark is collecting living plants or samples of the described species in the genus Pleurothallis in order to generate a molecular phylogeny representing possible evolutionary relationships in the genus. Molecular phylogenies such as this are developed through comparison of sequences in the nuclear or chloroplast genomes. This phylogeny will provide the basis for determining whether segregate, monophyletic genera can be created from species within the huge, highly diverse genus Pleurothallis. The research will also lead to the development of a database of DNA sequences unique to each Pleurothallis species, a so-called “DNA barcode,” such that in the future, identifications can be made even by untrained taxonomists, from a small sample of any plant in the genus, just by sequencing the appropriate DNA regions and comparison to the database. In addition to rapid identification, the barcoding can indicate that a species is not in the database and probably is undescribed, a “new” species. Mark has already collected several undescribed species, which will be described and named in the future. "@en ;

He has already located and obtained copies of every known surviving Roman Gradual (the book containing the music for Mass) printed in Italy, and secured copies of most of the Roman Antiphoners (the books containing the music for the Holy Office) also printed in Italy between the late 15th century and the late 17th century, the period of the most printing activity for plainchant editions. To date, he has delivered a number of papers and published several articles that have clarified the transmission of this printed repertoire and has successfully made analogies between the printed transmission of musical repertory and the earlier manuscript transmission of both monophony and polyphony (i.e., typesetter replaces scribe)."@en ;
