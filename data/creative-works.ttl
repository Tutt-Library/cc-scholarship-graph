    schema:about "For m ? N, let Sm be the Suzuki curve defined over F22m+1. It is well-known that Sm is supersingular, but the p-torsion group scheme of its Jacobian is not known. The a-number is an invariant of the isomorphism class of the p-torsion group scheme. In this paper, we compute a closed formula for the a-number of Sm using the action of the Cartier operator on H0(Sm,O1).

    schema:about "This article discusses a sample of 2,626 coins from an immense hoard of Athenian tetradrachms deposited 400 BC in northern Syria. A vast majority of the coins exhibit multiple types of surface markings. These markings include countermarks, cut countermark-like designs, graffiti, punch marks, cut edges and chisel cuts especially. Such markings are typical of smaller, contemporary hoards containing Athenian coinage found throughout the Near East. However, the large sample size offered by the present hoard further demonstrates that all of these different systems of surface markings conform to consistent patterns in placement and execution. There is nevertheless no similar consistency in the relationship between different marking systems appearing on the same coin. This suggests that each type of surface marking functioned independently but not exclusively as a regularized system of signification and circulation control within the Near East.]" ;

    schema:about "The article presents a criticism of the Greek historical text \"Histories,\" by Herodotus, in which the author analyzes the scene in book 5 where the Corinthian Socles speaks against Sparta's proposal to install a Persian ruler in Athens to curtail Athenian power in 504 BC. The author uses this scene to examine Herodotus' authorial voice of instructive irony to his contemporary audience. Topics include Socles' speech about tyranny and broader themes of political freedom, or ??e??e??a." ;

    schema:about "Although the universalising bent of Xenophon's leadership theory shows Socratic influence, its prioritisation of the general and the authorâ€™s fame for leading the Cyreans suggests an equal foundation in his battlefield experiences. In particular, the theoryâ€™s focus on securing willing obedience can be understood as a response to the novel fourth-century challenge of uniting ethnically disparate forces of free-agent mercenaries as an army, an issue central to Anabasis. Not only was Xenophon familiar with such a force, but he also shows an interest throughout his works in the advantages of mercenary professionalisation and specialisation, particularly with Jason of Pherae." ;

This paper describes the development and implementation of a method for assessing student learning outcomes in the MPA program at the University of Colorado Denver. The multi-method approach makes use of rubrics to examine whether students demonstrate the desired knowledge and skill, and student surveys to describe students' perceptions of their abilities in the same areas. Means for gaining faculty commitment to the process and making use of the information for program improvement are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher." ;

    schema:about "This article describes a collaborative mentoring program in which graduate students (fellows) from a university atmospheric science research department team-taught environmental science classes with professors in a liberal arts college. The mentorship allowed fellows to develop and test the effectiveness of curriculum based on the Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) approach. Qualitative analysis of narratives from four fellows who completed the mentoring program in an upper-level undergraduate atmospheric science class was used to develop three hypotheses about approaches to mentoring and teaching: (1) a constructivist-motivated approach to mentoring effectively allows graduate fellows to learn about constructivist-motivated pedagogy, (2) graduate fellows learn to formulate hypotheses related to the scholarship of teaching and learning by reflecting on their development and use of pedagogical innovations, and (3) the development and use of POGIL assignments and associated classroom pedagogy promotes graduate students' understanding of cognitive and social constructivist principles.

    schema:about "In the United States, men outnumber women in many science and engineering fields by nearly 3 to 1. In fields like physics or the geosciences, the gender gap can be even wider. Previous studies have identified the early college years as a critical point where many women exit STEM. An interdisciplinary team including expertise in the geosciences, psychology, education and STEM persistence have recently begun a 5-year project focused on understanding whether mentoring can increase the interest, persistence, and achievement of undergraduate women in the geosciences. The program focuses on mentoring first and second year female undergraduate students from four universities in Colorado and Wyoming and three universities in North and South Carolina. The mentoring program includes a weekend workshop, access to professional women across geoscience fields, and both in-person and virtual peer networks. The first weekend workshops were held in October 2015. The web-platform, designed to enable peer-mentoring and provide resources, was also launched in fall 2015: geosciencewomen.org. We will present an overview of the major components and lessons learned from the workshops. Using feedback from online surveys, we aim to 1) quantify the impact of the interventions (i.e. workshops and the professional and peer mentoring) on participants' intentions and behaviors related to geoscience career choices, 2) quantify the impact of the interventions on the skills and resources participants can use to overcome barriers for a career in the geosciences, and 3) quantify the key features of the interventions that predict positive changes in participants' perceptions of and beliefs about the geosciences. We will examine key processes that may explain why intervention elements have their effect on geoscience career choices. This project directly addresses diversity issues in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The activities aim to increase the number and diversity of women pursuing and completing an education in the geosciences. The project provides a program model and website for others to use, enhancing the potential for scalability." ;

    schema:about "When parents divorce, child support and visitation must be determined. The 1988 Family Support Act requires all states to have child support guidelines for courts to use in determining child support obligations. However, many divorcing couples arrive at agreements without court intervention, or they simply fail to enforce the court decision ex post. Given that the guidelines provide a starting point for negotiations, couples may be able to find self-negotiated, Pareto-improving solutions. In this paper we model the bargaining process that divorcing couples engage in when coming to agreements on visitation and child support. The model suggests that individuals may arrive at agreements that are Pareto improvements for both parents but that the children's welfare may decline as a result of these self-negotiated settlements. Data from the Stanford Child Custody Study show that the changes made in child support and visitation agreements are consistent with our model in only 30 percent of the cases. Therefore, we consider alternative specifications of the model and show that both significant costs of enforcing the original agreement and alternative assumptions on parental preferences can explain these empirical results." ;

    schema:about "This article examines politically motivated migration from El Salvador and Guatemala to the US. The author argues that the nature of these countries' insertion into the global economy require these states to devote considerable resources to establish relationships with their respective emigrant populations in the US. The Salvadoran immigrant hometown organizations have become incorporated into home country local development efforts at a higher level than their Guatemalan counterparts due to a more developed organizational structure, higher levels of interaction/collaboration with government officials, and a higher degree of democracy achieved in El Salvador as compared to Guatemala. Both Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrant organizations gain some leverage over the process of local development and politics in these countries. However, government policies that attempt to channel remittances will contribute little to productive development at the local level in the absence of state-supported macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in Guatemala and El Salvador.

    schema:about "We created two GIS labs (ArcGIS) that utilize the Learning for Use curricular design model (Edelson, 2001). Both labs are data-driven learning modules to motivate student learning and build new knowledge about climate and global change concepts. The first module utilizes satellite and model output data to engage students in predicting Earth's surface temperature without an atmosphere. Students then develop explanations as to the extent of radiative forcing providing by the atmosphere as a whole. These explanations are then compared with actual data; thus, allowing students to refine further their explanations. The second module uses a problem-based approach. Students are asked to use GIS to develop three scenarios, based on model data (Solomon, 2009 and Poore, et al., 2000) for global sea-level rise of 2.0, 17.0 and 90.0 meters. Students select their own geographic region to study, with many students choosing coastal communities with high population densities. Most students also chose to examine impacts on local hydrologic regimes. We present here preliminary data on student learning gains through implementation of knowledge surveys (Wirth, 2005)." ;

    schema:about "This paper evaluates the contribution of patent-related events to changes in stock prices, proposing that economics has traditionally failed to find much effect for two reasons which we identify and correct. First, patents vary widely in quality so we use quantile analysis and alternative measures of patent quality to identify effects. Second, we permit the possibility that information leaks out into investor sentiment during the long and uncertain time until patent grant, so evaluate the stock price effect at four different dates in the life of each patent. As a case study to test this approach, track all patents over a 27-year period for Apple Inc., permitting design patents to have different effects that traditional utility-model patents, and isolate the effect that Steve Jobs's name on a patent has at each stage of a patent's life." ;

We find benefits to diversification, identify the slope of the market risk-return line, and point out the most (and least) attractive potential students in terms of their projected future donations." ;

    schema:about "Small firms are qualitatively different than large firms with respect to technology acquisition. As such, liberalization of technology flows in newly industrialized nations may have two potential effects, possibly felt differentially by small firms and large firms. First, technology flows may replace domestic research with cheaper imported foreign research. Second, they may combine with domestic research to improve local economic growth. This paper uses a unique firm-level dataset, modelling the choice between R&D expenditures and technology licensing behaviour in Brazil, explicitly considering corner solutions. Extending the results found elsewhere in the literature, econometric estimation of simultaneous input demand for capital, labor and both types of technology acquisition reveals that while very small firms see technology licensing and R&D as contemporaneous substitutes, firms of moderate to large size treat them as complements. Each firm's licensing experience also plays a key role in the decision." ;

    schema:about "Drawing on psychological and sociological theories, this paper offers suggestions for redefining and implementing academic rigor in higher education. After examining the misunderstandings and misuse of rigor through an overview of common definitions and measurements, I propose a new conceptualization of rigor grounded in developmental and cognitive psychology. Rooted in that definition, I provide two pedagogical methods, with detailed examples, for cultivating academically rigorous experiences in college classrooms. Lastly, I briefly summarize the cultural and structural changes necessary in academe to facilitate the progression of rigor from theory to praxis. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

    schema:about "In this paper, we employ three simple theoretical models of nonprofit hospitals to investigate equilibrium behavior when hospitals compete. Utilizing a differentiated Bertrand model, we examine how prices, quantity of patients served, service to the uninsured, and quality of care are affected as nonprofits place more weight on profit maximization. We find that the specification of the nonprofit motive greatly impacts the results. When the nonprofit motive is maximizing output, prices rise for both hospitals as the nonprofit moves away from its nonprofit motive. However, if the nonprofit cares about serving the uninsured, prices in the market fall. Finally, when hospitals compete on price and quality, more emphasis on profits results in an increase in price at the for-profit hospital and a decrease in price at the nonprofit hospital. These results suggest that the importance of the nonprofit motive has been underestimated and should be further investigated." ;

    schema:about "You are my sunshine is familiar to many people, for whom it was first heard during childhood as a lullaby or campfire sing-along. Beyond such oral transmission, this song's presence is also maintained in North American culture through recordings. The various recordings of You are my sunshine demonstrate the commercial viability of the song and its widespread appeal to both artists and their listeners, regardless of racial, sociological, or geographical background. Beginning with its supposed composition in the 1940s, a series of songs that form a recorded pedigree for You are my sunshine is examined, demonstrating how each version's musical components contributed to what became the standard (and copyrighted) version of the song." ;

From an early age, not only did Bernstein have a particular vision of how Rhapsody should operate; he also identified deeply with it. These findings provide important new insights into Bernstein's later, more polemical interpretations of the work in both recordings and the concert hall-interpretations that have had profound implications on the reception of Rhapsody on the global stage." ;

    schema:about "Considers the role that arrangements of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in blue, created and performed by Duke Ellington and his Ensemble, play in the construction of historical narratives about concert jazz. On their own, both the Rhapsody and Ellington appear to perform well-established roles: the Rhapsody remains the quintessential example of symphonic jazz in now-loaded definitions of the term and Ellington's output in this arena -- often referred to by jazz scholars as extended jazz composition -- forms a counter-narrative. Accordingly, a racialized barrier between the black, 'authentic' extended jazz compositions of Ellington and the white, 'inauthentic' symphonic jazz of Gershwin has emerged in critical and scholarly accounts of these traditions. However, when Ellington and the Rhapsody are considered in tandem, these barriers become more complex and permeable. Here, I consider three arrangements that survive in the Duke Ellington Collection at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The arrangements performed in 1925 and 1932 remove long-held assumptions that the Rhapsody was the provenience of white bands and provide insight into Ellington's own development of concertized jazz. The third version was recorded for Ellington's 1963 album Will big bands ever come back? Musical choices made within this latter arrangement align with then-present expectations of how the Ellington band of an earlier era should have sounded. Given Ellington's demonstrated interest in musical-historical narratives, I posit that specific decisions were made with respect to instrumentation and improvisation in an attempt to secure his place within the remapping of jazz history that occurred during the 1960s." ;

    schema:about "CrystallineInAs films have been prepared directly at room temperaturethrough a new electrochemically induced alloying method by controllablyreducing As2O3dissolved in an alkaline aqueoussolution at an indium (In) foil electrode. Steady-state Raman spectra,transmission electron microscopy, and selected area electron diffractionindicated that the as-prepared films crystallize in the zincblendephase with no further thermal treatments. Cyclic voltammetry measurements,optical images, and steady-state Raman spectra confirmed that a cleanoxide-free interface is critical for the successful formation of thebinary InAs phase. The salient feature of this work is the use ofsimple aqueous electrochemistry to simultaneously remove passive metaloxides from the In(s) metal surface while controllably reducing dissolvedarsenic oxide at the interface to drive the In–As alloyingreaction. Raman spectral mapping data illustrate that the resultingfilm coverage and homogeneity are a strong function of the formalAs2O3concentration and the duration of theelectrodeposition experiment. Potential-dependent in situ Raman spectroscopywas used to implicate the solid-state reaction as the rate-limitingstep in InAs film formation over the first 160 min, after which solid-statediffusion dominated the kinetics. The collective results establisha precedent for an alternative synthetic strategy for crystallineInAs thin films that does not require vacuum or sophisticated furnaces,toxic gaseous precursors like arsine, or exotic solvents.

    schema:about "The substrate-overlayer approachhas been used to acquire surfaceenhanced Raman spectra (SERS) during and after electrochemical atomiclayer deposition (ECALD) of CdSe, CdTe, and CdS thin films. The collecteddata suggest that SERS measurements performed with off-resonance (i.e.far from the surface plasmonic wavelength of the underlying SERS substrate)laser excitation do not introduce perturbations to the ECALD processes.Spectra acquired in this way afford rapid insight on the quality ofthe semiconductor film during the course of an ECALD process. Forexample, SERS data are used to highlight ECALD conditions that yieldcrystalline CdSe and CdS films. In contrast, SERS measurements withshort wavelength laser excitation show evidence of photoelectrochemicaleffects that were not germane to the intended ECALD process. Usingthe semiconductor films prepared by ECALD, the substrate-overlayerSERS approach also affords analysis of semiconductor surface adsorbates.Specifically, Raman spectra of benzenethiol adsorbed onto CdSe, CdTe,and CdS films are detailed. Spectral shifts in the vibronic featuresof adsorbate bonding suggest subtle differences in substrate-adsorbateinteractions, highlighting the sensitivity of this methodology.

    bf:Summary "Soren Kierkegaard's Concluding Unscientific Postscript has provoked a lively variety of divergent interpretations for a century and a half. It has been both celebrated and condemned as the chief inspiration for twentieth-century existential thought, as a subversive parody of philosophical argument, as a critique of mass society, as a forerunner of phenomenology and of postmodern relativism, and as an appeal for a renewal of religious commitment. These 2010 essays written by international Kierkegaard scholars offer a plurality of critical approaches to this fundamental text of existential philosophy. They cover hotly debated topics such as the tension between the Socratic-philosophical and the Christian-religious; the identity and personality of Kierkegaard's pseudonym 'Johannes Climacus'; his conceptions of paradoxical faith and of passionate understanding; his relation to his contemporaries and to some of his more distant predecessors; and, last but not least, his pertinence to our present-day concerns."@en ;

    schema:about "Scenario analysis is a useful tool for exploring key uncertainties that may shape the future of social-ecological systems. This paper explores the methods, costs, and benefits of developing and linking scenarios of social-ecological systems across multiple spatial scales. Drawing largely on experiences in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we suggest that the desired degree of cross-scale linkage depends on the primary aim of the scenario exercise. Loosely linked multiscale scenarios appear more appropriate when the primary aim is to engage in exploratory dialog with stakeholders. Tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios seem to work best when the main objective is to further our understanding of cross-scale interactions or to assess trade-offs between scales. The main disadvantages of tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios are that their development requires substantial time and financial resources, and that they often suffer loss of credibility at one or more scales. The reasons for developing multiscale scenarios and the expectations associated with doing so therefore need to be carefully evaluated when choosing the desired degree of cross-scale linkage in a particular scenario exercise." ;

    schema:about "For at least the past 8000 years, small-scale farmers in semi-arid environments have had to mitigate shortfalls in crop production due to variation in precipitation and stream flow. To reduce their vulnerability to a shortfall in their food supply, small-scale farmers developed short-term strategies, including storage and community-scale sharing, to mitigate inter-annual variation in crop production, and long-term strategies, such as migration, to mitigate the effects of sustained droughts. We use the archaeological and paleoclimatic records from A.D. 900-1600 in two regions of the American Southwest to explore the nature of variation in the availability of water for crops, and the strategies that enhanced the resilience of prehistoric agricultural production to climatic variation. Drawing on information concerning contemporary small-scale farming in semi-arid environments, we then suggest that the risk coping and mitigation strategies that have endured for millennia are relevant to enhancing the resilience of contemporary farmers' livelihoods to environmental and economic perturbations." ;

    bf:Summary "In a paper titled 'How to Make Our Ideas Clear,' C. S. Peirce outlines an elegant thought experiment on scientific progress and the notion of truth. John Staddon offered an interesting corollary to Peirce's thought experiment. For Peirce, truth was found in the dovetailing of inquiry onto a 'fated' agreement among observers. How, Staddon asks, will psychology look when science has run its course and our understanding of behavior has reached its limit--when our theories exhaust our understanding of behavior and answer our questions to the degree possible through scientific method? However interesting the debate over what is true or real is to the philosophically inclined, Peirce's thought experiment raises the question that Staddon finally asks: What can we expect from our theories at the limits of scientific inquiry? And specifically for psychologists: What can we expect from a science of psychology at the limits of inquiry? Psychology has a special interest in this question, because much of the debate on methodology in psychology rests upon what will count as a scientific explanation of psychological phenomena. How can we know what the important questions of our field are, if we do not know what constitutes a suitable explanation? The history of psychology is replete with arguments about the appropriate subject and nature of the study of psychology. We turn next to a short, schematic history of psychological explanation as a way of exploring the tensions within the field over what will count as an explanation.

    schema:about "The May 12th, 2008 Sichuan earthquake was a national trauma in China. The reconstruction provided the Party with an opportunity to display its care for the disaster victims and restore the Party's shaken credibility and socialist legitimacy. Despite initial collective solidarity and firm control over the state apparatus, levers of the economy, and domestic media, the Party did not manage to secure broad public approval of its reconstruction effort in the earthquake zone. This article argues that the reasons for this failure can be traced to the Party's political epistemology. The CCP's general assumptions, governmental rationalities, policy calculations, implementation strategies, and legitimating discourses organized the reconstruction. It wanted to build a model of state power and benevolence, but it did not have the proper tools. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

    schema:about "Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonns ponderosae) is the most important insect pest in southern Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine (Finns ponderosa) forests. Tree mortality is hastened by the various fungal pathogens that are symbiotic with the beetles. The phenylpropanoid 4-allylanisole is an antifungal and semiochemical for some pine beetle species. We analyzed 4-allylanisole and monoterpene profiles in the xylem oleoresin from a total of 107 trees at six sites from two chemotypes of poriderosa pine found in Colorado and New Mexico using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Although monoterpene profiles were essentially the same in attacked and nonattacked trees, significantly lower levels of 4-allylanisole were found in attacked trees compared with trees that showed no evidence of attack for both chemotypes.

    schema:about "This essay is an attempt to add to the argument that beauty matters in education through offering a reciprocal but interconnected point: if the dynamic harmony and deep connectedness of beauty need to be taken seriously, so must their aesthetic converse--the disharmony and estrangement of failure. While the discourse of philosophical aesthetics has long included categories such as the beautiful, the good, and the virtuous, the seeds for achievement of these ideals are planted in the soil of disharmony, uncertainty, and failure. Using a Deweyan account of art as experience, this essay argues that disharmony and failure are as much aesthetic categories as harmony and beauty and must be taken as seriously in teaching and learning. It further argues that failure, rather than beauty, is often more suited to providing the foundation for unlocking the unique potential of students and helping them cultivate their capacity for creative thought and action.

    schema:about "&nbsp;The purported crisis and opportunity in liberal education may be approached via a reconsideration of the arts in liberal arts education. The advantage of such a view is that proponents of humanistic liberal education could speak in their own terms, while incorporating in a systematic way studies of ancient and modem liberal arts, addressing public questions of the value and substance of a liberal education. A plausible issue for consideration is whether the \"arts\" can address a crisis, its purported causes and solutions, and the key role the humanities may have in building a renewed liberal arts education. At stake in the classroom is the realization of the possibilities, the intellectual freedom, which humans make for themselves in artistic making. This freedom differs from, but is complementary to, political freedom, the loadstone of standard liberal education defenses, because it is based in innovations and inventions of the arts and sciences, not in constitutions or politics of democracy." ;

Two types are delineated: applications for access and discovery, which are available to everyone; and productivity applications, which are primarily for library staff to administer and manage the FRBR-RDA records. The access portfolio includes Book Search, Article Search, Call Number, and Library Hours applications. The productivity side includes an Orders App and a MARC Batch application for ingesting MARC records as FRBR entities using RDA Core attributes. When a critical threshold is reached, the Tutt Library intends to replace its legacy ILS with this library application portfolio." ;

    schema:about "Carbon isotope ratios of mammalian tooth enamel have long been used to infer the diet of animals in the past, and hence the ecological makeup of their surroundings. In general these studies have relied on large differences in carbon isotope ratios between plants utilizing C4 and C3 photosynthetic pathways to infer changes in paleodiet and hence paleoecology over time and space. However, significant carbon isotope variations can occur within C3 plants alone as a result of differences in light, water availability, humidity, position in the forest canopy, temperature, and altitude. Therefore carbon isotope ratios of mammalian tooth enamel for pre-Miocene time periods when C4 plants were uncommon may still be used as valuable paleoecological and paleoenvironmental indicators. This study focuses on the Eocene time period and relies on the analysis of tooth enamel carbonate from Coryphodon, a large herbivorous mammal that lived in riverine environments. Intra-tooth variations in carbon isotope ratios of 1 to 2 per mil are observed for samples from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, and are weakly correlated with seasonal variations in oxygen isotope ratios. These carbon isotope variations may reflect seasonal changes in habitat and/or types of C3 plants eaten by Coryphodon. Alternatively they may reflect the influence of temperature or water/nutrient availability on carbon isotope ratios of a single C3 plant type. In addition to seasonal variations, carbon isotope ratios of Coryphodon vary with latitude. Samples from San Jan Basin ( approximately 36 degrees N paleolatitude), Bighorn Basin ( approximately 45 degrees N) and Ellesmere ( approximately 75 degrees N) have average values of -15.0, 13.0, and -12.5 per mil respectively. The resulting negative correlation between carbon isotope ratios and temperature/latitude is different than that observed for C3 plants at the present time, and may instead reflect the influence of biological productivity, precipitation, or water availability. These results confirm that carbon isotope ratios of tooth enamel can vary significantly in a C3 world, and that seasonal and spatial patterns can provide information regarding mammalian habitat and environmental conditions of the past." ;

    schema:about "As air masses rise over orographic barriers, rainout results in a decrease in delta 18O that has a quantifiable relation with elevation. Thus a comparison of delta 18O of materials preserved in ancient and adjacent basins can be used to estimate the relief of mountains between them. For the early Eocene, average delta 18O values for riverine bivalve carbonate, river fish scales, and mammalian tooth enamel phosphate are approximately 1.1 per mil higher for the Powder River basin (WY) than the Bighorn basin to the west, with estimated river delta 18O values of approximately -7 to -9 per mil and -9 to -10.5 per mil, respectively. Global climate model simulations indicate predominant wind directions from the east and south. Thus this inter-basinal difference in delta 18O is likely due to the ancient Bighorn Mountains standing approximately 250-520 m between the basin floors. Anomalously low delta 18O values for bivalve carbonate indicate that Bighorn basin river waters may have been as low as approximately -21 per mil. Rather than representing permanent snow and hence much higher relief, it is proposed that these rare, low delta 18O values reflect (1) episodic changes in atmospheric circulation which introduce highly distilled moisture from Pacific sources to the Bighorn basin; or (2) transient cooling events that lead to cooler winter temperatures and winter accumulations of higher elevation snow." ;

    schema:about "Carbon in fossil tooth enamel of herbivorous vertebrates has an ultimate source in plant matter ingested by them. In turn, carbon isotope ratios of plants are influenced by both the photosynthetic pathways they utilize and by local environmental conditions. Thus, carbon isotope analyses of tooth enamel from herbivorous dinosaurs paired with the analysis of organic material from plants can be used to investigate terrestrial ecosystems during the Mesozoic. This approach can be applied to the study of paleoecology in to main ways. One is to compare carbon isotope ratios of organic material and tooth enamel samples from different sites of approximately the same age in an effort to make an ecological \"map\" of that time period. As an example of this approach, hadrosaurian dinosaur teeth were collected from late Campanian sites in Baja, Mexico, Texas, Utah, Montana, and Alaska. Intra-site carbon isotope variations of 2 to 6 per mil were observed, and average carbon isotope ratios between sites ranged from -10 to +3 per mil. Environmental conditions, plant ecology, and animal migration can all play a role in causing these isotopic variations, and can therefore be investigated using this approach. For example, high carbon isotope ratios from coastal localities indicate that plants utilizing C4 photosynthetic pathways may have been common at this time along the Western Interior Seaway. As another example, carbon isotope ratios among some localities do not overlap, thus indicating that animal migration between areas was limited. Alternatively, samples can be obtained from a stratigraphic series of sites located in one area in order to study ecological changes over time. In the case of the Maastrictian Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota, carbon isotope ratios of hadrosaurian tooth enamel increase gradually from approximately -6 to -1 per mil over the last million years of the Cretaceous. This increase may reflect the impact of temperature change or saltwater incursions associated with changing sea levels on carbon isotope ratios of plants living in the Hell creek ecosystem. Carbon isotope records from tooth enamel and organic material can be compared to paleoenvironmental information obtained from plant megafossils found in the same sediments, and to marine isotope records of the same age." ;

    schema:about "Sediments from Brewster Bog, northeastern Ohio provide a detailed record of late Pleistocene and early Holocene environmental change. Organic material from a 9.5 m-long core was analyzed to evaluate changes in organic productivity and landscape stabilization after glaciation. Carbon isotope ratios of peat from the core were analyzed to investigate moisture changes over the last glacial-interglacial transition. The sediments record a classic deglacial climate sequence. The post-glacial Bolling-Allerod warming is indicated by an abrupt upcore increase in organic content ca. 12,740+ or -100 (super 14) C yr B.P. (AA53416). A subsequent sharp decrease in organic content is suggestive of the inception of a cool period and resembles a Younger Dryas signal, but is slightly older (11,380+ or -50 (super 14) C; Beta-172290) than the Younger Dryas interval recorded elsewhere in the region. The onset of Holocene warming after this interval is evident in an upcore change from low to very high organic content. Carbon isotopes from Sphagnum peat also suggest multiple dry periods during the early Holocene. The Brewster basin progressed through wetland phases in response to variations in climate. The carbon isotope data indicate that a transition from fen to bog occurred synchronous with the termination of the Younger Dryas. This localized environmental change is attributed to lower water levels induced by Younger Dryas aridity. Correlation with regional palynological and stratigraphic data suggests that the environmental changes recorded in Brewster Bog occurred in response to regional-scale climate variations." ;

    schema:about "In order to understand metamorphic history of Syros, Greece, a petrologic and geochemical analysis of marbles and calc-silicates was undertaken. Temperature estimates made using calcite-graphite carbon isotope thermometry and calcite-dolomite cation exchange thermometry were compared to temperatures obtained from petrologic geothermobarometry. In addition, carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of carbonates were used to investigate fluid flow in marbles. Three distinct rock units on Syros all appear to have experienced a high pressure-low temperature blueschist to eclogite grade event at approximately 55 Ma and a greenschist overprint at approximately 25 Ma. Equilibrium mineral assemblages in marbles include epidote-group minerals that indicate that peak temperatures were between 510 degrees and 600 degrees C, while garnet-bearing assemblages indicate that retrograde metamorphic temperatures were above 530 degrees C. Temperatures estimated using calcite-graphite thermometry averaged 335 degrees C + or - 67 degrees C, while estimates made using calcite-dolomite geothermometry yielded temperatures of 407 degrees C + or - 111 degrees C. Of these, silicate mineral assemblages most likely provide accurate estimates of peak and retrograde temperatures. Estimates made using calcite-graphite thermometry reflect prograde conditions, resulting in lower temperatures because graphite crystals in marble did not fully equilibrate with surrounding calcite. In contrast, calcite-dolomite temperatures likely represent retrograde conditions as re-equilibration between phases can occur quickly even at lower temperatures. Fluid flow during metamorphism appears to be limited. Positive correlations between carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of carbonates at hand-sample scale are consistent with variable loss of small amounts of fluids during prograde decarbonation reactions. In turn, isotope heterogeneity between hand-samples over an outcrop scale and limited isotopic exchange across silicate-marble contacts indicates that fluid movement was localized and was not pervasive in marble units or between marble and surrounding metapelite units. By investigating metamorphism on Syros using these different methods, it is possible to provide a more complete metamorphic history of the island." ;

    schema:about "Sedimentary organic matter and dinosaur tooth enamel have been collected from several Late Cretaceous coastal localities in the Hell Creek Formations of North Dakota. Carbon isotope ratios of organic matter range from -26 to -17 per mil, while ratios of tooth enamel range from -10 to -1 per mil. Ratios higher that -20 and -4 per mil, respectively, cannot be easily accounted for by plants utilizing C3 photosynthetic pathways, and may indicate that plants utilizing C4 mechanisms were a part of certain terrestrial ecosystems in this region during the Cretaceous. The oldest fossil evidence for C4 plants is from the middle Miocene, and the global expansion of C4 grasslands common at the present time did not occur until later in the Miocene. Leading theories of C4 evolution hold that the C4 pathway is a favorable adaptation to lowering atmospheric CO2 levels, more open/light habitats, and increasing aridity that occurred during the late Cenozoic. These conclusions, however, do not preclude the possibility that C4 plants other than modern grasses were abundant in other terrestrial settings at an earlier time. C4 photosynthetic pathways are polyphyletic traits that may have evolved independently many times in the past. More importantly, environmental conditions along the coasts of the Western Interior Seaway of North America were such that plants utilizing the C4 pathway would have had several advantages over C3 plants. In particular, the high water use efficiency that provides C4 plants with an advantage in arid environments also favors them under saline conditions, as does their rapid growth in periodically disturbed areas such as coastal floodplains. C4-dominated ecosystems can be found at the present time in saline coastal environments in North America and Europe, and it is suggested that they had antecedents in coastal, mudflat/salt marsh biomes that existed along shallow Cretaceous oceans. Equally exciting, these biomes may have been a major food source for certain dinosaur taxa. If so, the evolution, ecological diversity, and importance of C4 plants may be more complicated and expansive than previously realized." ;

    schema:about "Carbon isotope studies of mammal tooth enamel have provided a great deal of information regarding Late Tertiary environments and plant-animal interactions. To date, however, it has been difficult to study Mesozoic environments and ecology using dinosaur enamel because of unknown aspects of dinosaur physiology, the lack of modern analogs, and difficulties in determining the extent of diagenesis. To address these problems, we measured isotope ratios of carbonate from hadrosaurian and ceratopsian teeth of the Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota as well as associated sedimentary organic material. Diagenesis was investigated by sampling enamel and dentine from the same teeth and comparing results to bone samples. Patterns in the isotopic data are consistent with better preservation of carbon isotope ratios in enamel relative to other phases and agree with structural differences between enamel and dentine. Nevertheless, the degree to which material has been altered is difficult to constrain by this method alone. Diagenesis was also assessed by comparing carbon isotope ratios of dinosaur enamel to ratios of associated sedimentary organic material. Assuming the latter reflects herbivorous dinosaur diet, the offset between these two phases should be constant, as is observed in the case of mammals. For 5 of 6 sites this offset was in fact constant at approximately 17 per mil. At one locality, however, a larger difference of approximately 25 per mil was observed, and is interpreted to reflect diagenetic alteration of enamel carbonate. The dinosaur enamel-diet offset is greater than that for birds ( approximately 16 per mil) and mammals ( approximately 14 per mil) and reflects differences in physiology. Lastly, a comparison of average isotope ratios between dinosaur taxa may also be used to study diagenesis. At several locations, average ratios for hadrosaurians and ceratopsians are significantly different. Such patterns cannot be accounted for by diagenetic processes given similarities in enamel thicknesses and structure and thus provide an additional means of monitoring diagenesis. While none of these methods alone may be used to rule out the effects of diagenesis, a combined approach can provide a means of identifying large diagenetic changes in primary carbon isotope ratios. As a result, isotope data can be used to investigate dinosaur ecology of the Mesozoic." ;

    schema:about "Warming during the PETM has been documented worldwide, and is usually attributed to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases such as CO (sub 2) . To date, only a few proxies for the partial pressure of CO (sub 2) in the atmosphere (pCO (sub 2) ) have provided records for the Paleogene, and only a single data point represents the PETM interval in particular. Thus the exact role of CO (sub 2) in this period of rapid warming remains ambiguous. One area that has the potential to provide high-resolution records of pCO (sub 2) for the PETM interval is the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, where this time is represented by tens of meters of sediment. Carbon isotope records from paleosol carbonates and from dispersed organic matter have been obtained from these rocks, thus it should be possible to estimate pCO (sub 2) using a diffusion-reaction model for the carbon isotope ratio of soil CO (sub 2) and soil carbonate. Unfortunately, making useful estimates is easier said than done. The primary difficulty is that the diffusion model approach is characterized by a number of different variables, and that estimates of pCO (sub 2) obtained using it vary drastically depending on input parameters (e.g., temperature, isotope ratio of vegetation and atmosphere, partial pressure of CO (sub 2) in soils). For example, if \"typical\" assumptions are made (MAT = 25 degrees C, carbon isotope ratio of vegetation inferred from that of marine carbonate, soil pCO (sub 2) = 5000 ppmv), pCO (sub 2) decreases during the PETM to negative values. Even estimates made using independent records of MAT and carbon isotope data from sedimentary organic matter result in low estimates of pCO (sub 2) , with a negligible/negative change in pCO (sub 2) across the PETM. The best-constrained estimates are those that also account for isotopic degradation of organic matter in soils, and these indicate that pCO (sub 2) increased during the PETM. The magnitude of the increase, however, is dependent on assumed partial pressure of CO (sub 2) in soils. Thus lack of specific information regarding soil pCO (sub 2) ultimately results in equivocal estimates of pCO (sub 2) using this method. Models of soil carbon dynamics during the Eocene, studies of modern soil systems, and/or independent estimates of pCO (sub 2) obtained using other proxy records may allow better estimates of soil pCO (sub 2) to be made, thus overcoming these problems." ;

    schema:about "Recent research indicates that short-term variations in climate, in particular temperature, occurred over western North America during the early Eocene. Records of amounts of precipitation, however, are lacking. Furthermore, causes of such relatively short and small climatic variations are not well understood. To address these issues, we analyzed stable isotope data collected from several mammalian taxa that covers the first approximately 1.4 Ma of the Eocene. Differences in oxygen and carbon isotope ratios among taxa that are inferred to ingest water from rivers versus plant leaves provide a qualitative measure of aridity, and thus amount of precipitation. In addition, major element data were collected from paleosols associated with these fossil remains. Elemental ratios from these soils are related to the extent of chemical weathering, which in turn is tied to amount of precipitation. Oxygen and carbon isotopic data indicate that the first 1.4 Ma of the Eocene was characterized by three episodes of significant aridity, as identified by an increase in the isotopic offset between riparian (e.g. Coryphodon) and open forest (e.g Hyracotherium) taxa. The occurrence of these dry periods appears to be confirmed by a second, and completely independent, measure of aridity. In this case, paleosols found associated with mammal remains have higher ratios of mobile to immobile elements, which is consistent with reduced chemical weathering and thus water flux, during these arid episodes. All of these dry intervals predate a known cool period in the Bighorn basin, and have not been described heretofore. In an effort to identify the cause of these geochemical, and thus climatic, variations over time, we conducted time series analyses of our records. Preliminary results indicate that orbital variations, particularly those associated with eccentricity, played a role in driving these changes in aridity." ;

    schema:about "Geoscientists have debated for several decades whether the Rocky Mountains eroded after the Laramide Orogeny (ca. 65 mya) and subsequently underwent a third orogeny or whether they simply remained high throughout the Cenozoic. Workers have used various methods to approach these problems of paleotopography and paleoelevation, most notably leaf-margin analysis of fossil floras, stable isotope analysis of sediments and fossil remains, and geomorphic analysis of sediments. This study relies on stable isotope analyses of fossil remains, particularly of mammalian tooth enamel, but compares isotope data from a broad geographic region in order to make isotopic maps. These maps can provide insight into topographic relief and elevation that are difficult to obtain by studying individual localities alone. Samples of tooth enamel were taken from five genera of mammals that lived during the latest Eocene (Chadronian LMA). These remains are from seven fossil localities in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. Samples from eastern Colorado and western Nebraska have oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of approximately -6.1 + or - 1.4 per mil and approximately -10.1 + or - 0.9 per mil, respectively. At and to the west of the eastern edge of the present-day Front Range, samples from Castle Rock and Florissant have similar oxygen and carbon isotope ratios to those of eastern Colorado and western Nebraska. In contrast to these other localities, samples from the flanks of the present-day Laramie Mountains in Wyoming have oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of approximately -9.7 + or - 1.3 per mil and approximately -7.7 + or - 1.9 per mil, respectively. At present, these sites in eastern and central Colorado and western Nebraska range in elevation from 1165 to 2445 meters, and have oxygen isotope ratios for river water ranging from -13 to -18 per mil. Because our Eocene samples have both lower oxygen isotope ratios and a smaller range in values, we interpret them to reflect low relief and low elevation at that time when compared to the present day. In contrast, lower oxygen isotope ratios and higher carbon isotope ratios from sites along the flanks of the Laramie Mountains during the late Eocene are consistent with localized relief in this area of approximately 1 km. The latter inference is consistent with previous sedimentological studies of the late Eocene-early Oligiocene erosional surface in this region." ;

    schema:about "The study of paleoelevation and paleorelief using stable isotope approaches relies extensively on utilizing isotopic data obtained from authigenic or biogenic minerals as a proxy for stable isotope ratios of ancient precipitation. It is well known, however, that these minerals do not form in equilibrium with precipitation, rather that form from \"surface waters\" that can be affected by a variety of hydrological processes. Equally important, these minerals also form over a range of geochemical conditions, and therefore potentially at different times of the year. For example, clays minerals form when soils are wet, carbonate minerals form when soils are drying, and vertebrates drink and form enamel at all times of the year. Both the hydrological processes that may effect oxygen isotope ratios of \"surface waters\" and possible seasonal biases in the timing of mineral formation need to be considered (1) when assuming the oxygen isotope ratio of low-elevation waters that are then compared with high-elevation proxy data, (2) when comparing isotopic data obtained from different minerals to make stable isotope maps (3) when applying empirical or model lapse rates based on the analysis of mean annual precipitation (4) when comparing proxy isotope data to modern isotope data of precipitation. Examples of problems that may arise if these variables are not considered are illustrated using published isotope data. Examples will also be given of the benefits of collecting isotopic data from multiple proxies, specifically those related to a more precise characterization of paleoclimate." ;

    schema:about "The large floral diversity and preservation of cuticle associated with paleosol deposits makes the Castle Rock Rainforest (CRR) an ideal place to study the carbon isotope systematics of a Paleogene forest. Carbon isotope data from this setting can be used (1) to try and describe the physical structure of this fossil forest and (2) to study the cycling of carbon in ancient soils. These kinds of studies are possible because carbon isotope ratios of C (sub 3) plants vary in response to differences in environmental conditions of plant growth within the forest canopy, and to the recycling of CO (sub 2) in a closed-canopy setting, while ratios of soil organic matter can be influenced by microbial processes. For this study 139 individual leaves from 10 of the most common taxa were analyzed along with 70 paleosol samples. Carbon isotope ratios of leaves ranged from -28.8 to -24.8ppm with an average of -26.8 + or - 0.8ppm. Cycads, ferns, and leaves coming from low-lying shoots have lowest average ratios of -28.4, -27.4, and -27.0ppm, respectively, while averages of other leaf types range as high as -25.9ppm. Isotopic variability within a leaf type ranges from 0.5 to 0.9ppm. Paleosols have an average isotope ratio of -25.6 + or - 0.6ppm. The overall variability in carbon isotope ratios of CRR leaves is less than that observed for modern tropical forests in Africa and Brazil that are characterized by a pronounced carbon isotope \"canopy-effect\" (+ or - 1.5 to 3ppm around the mean). Lower carbon isotope ratios from 3 separate kinds of understory leaves, however, suggest that the CRR was closed in its structure. If CRR trees were shorter or narrower relative to modern forests, it could help explain the smaller observed range in carbon isotope ratios from CRR. Alternatively, leaves from the top of the CRR canopy may not be well represented in the fossil leaf litter thus reducing the amount of isotopic variability \"captured\" by our sampling. Carbon isotope ratios of soil organic matter from the CRR are higher than those of associated plants, a pattern observed in modern tropical forests. This offset is indicative of microbial fractionation of carbon in organic matter during decomposition in soils, with (super 12) C becoming preferentially incorporated into respired CO (sub 2) . This CO (sub 2) presumably contributed to the lower carbon isotope ratios/closed-canopy signal preserved in understory leaves from the CRR." ;

    schema:about "Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tooth enamel are related to those of ingested food and water, and can thus be used to study animal biology and behavior. Isotopic offsets are observed for enamel from both coexisting herbivorous dinosaurs and mammals, thus indicating that dietary niche partitioning was common in the Arctic during both late Cretaceous and Eocene time. Isotopic offsets among herbivores and carnivores can be used to infer common prey of the latter. A comparison of isotopic data from the same taxa living above the Arctic Circle and at lower latitudes is consistent with animals living in polar regions all year. Focusing on oxygen isotope data, oxygen isotope gradients inferred from enamel are shallower than at present. Intra-tooth/seasonal variations in oxygen isotope ratios in polar regions during both time periods is greater than at lower latitudes for each time slice, but is much less than at present in both cases. Both observations are consistent with fossil evidence for amplified warming in polar regions compared to the tropics, and thus shallower temperature gradients for both the Late Cretaceous and Eocene time periods. Diagenetic patterns in isotopic data provide insight into mechanisms of amplified polar warming during hothouse time periods. Carbon isotope ratios of dentine, which is more susceptible to alteration than enamel, are much higher than associated enamel at polar localities, with values reaching +5 per mil. These high values suggest methane production/stratospheric cloud formation at high latitudes during both times." ;

    schema:about "An old problem in vertebrate paleontology is determining what extinct organisms ate. Because carbon isotope ratios of tooth enamel are related to those of ingested food, isotopic studies of enamel complement those of tooth morphology and microwear. Application of carbon isotope studies is most straightforward for herbivores, and dietary inferences are made by comparing carbon isotope data from enamel with isotopic data from modern plants. Although isotopic data from modern plants provide a basis for making broad dietary distinctions (e.g. preference for C3 versus C4 plants or for open versus closed C3 vegetation) this approach has limits. One is lack of modern studies, with the result that isotopic differences among plants observed in one setting are assumed to be appropriate across a range of environments. Another critical limitation is that modern and fossil plants are not the same, and ancient taxa that are morphologically similar to modern plants may have had different physiologies and environmental preferences. Thus it is difficult to infer specific dietary distinctions for herbivores (e.g. preference for herbaceous versus woody angiosperms or angiosperms versus gymnosperms), particularly for pre-Miocene time periods. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to measure carbon isotope ratios of fossil plants found associated with herbivores (or that are at least the same age). The challenge for paleobotanigeochemists is making these measurements. Leaf cuticle provides an excellent substrate for analysis, but can be rare in association with plant macrofossils. More commonly, such fossils are comprised of an \"organic\" residue that is not/poorly characterized. If it is possible to determine the organic compounds present, and to identify one that is primary and that is common across taxa, then it will be possible to delineate carbon isotopic differences among ancient plants. This will in turn allow for more accurate paleodietary studies of ancient vertebrates." ;

    schema:about "The elevation history of the Western US is intimately tied to, and offers valuable insight for the interpretation of, both the tectonic history and landscape evolution of this region. Oxygen isotope ratios (delta (super 18) O) of ancient precipitation have the potential to provide information regarding the paleoelevation of orogenic regions because of the cooling of rising air masses and the subsequent rainout of moisture and preferential removal of (super 18) O. The end result is that for an individual air mass moving up a topographic gradient, a pattern of decreasing delta (super 18) O values is observed, and an isotopic lapse rate can be used to infer paleoelevation. Interpretations of patterns in delta (super 18) O , however, are not straightforward in regions such as the Western US where precipitation in any given place may be sourced from a number of different air masses with different source areas, distances of transport and elevation rainout histories. In an effort to overcome these potential problems, we use an atmospheric global climate model with integrated oxygen isotope tracers (isoCAM3) that predicts isotope ratios of precipitation in different regions of the Western US based on \"first principles\". This model is run for a given time period using a range of possible elevations/topographies, and simulated oxygen isotope ratios are compared to those obtained from geologic materials (e.g. fossil bivalves, mammal teeth, authigenic minerals). Quantification of match between model and data-derived delta (super 18) O values, assessment of possible source mixing ratios, and identification of air mass trajectories are then interpreted to identify the best approximation of regional paleotopography. Application of this integrated climate model-oxygen isotope approach to the study of paleoelevation in the Western US for three different time slices is ongoing. During the Late Cretaceous ( approximately 75 Ma) when the Western Interior Seaway covered much of the eastern part of the region, results indicate that Sevier highlands to the west were comparable in mean elevation to the modern Andes. Preliminary comparisons for the early ( approximately 55 Ma) and late ( approximately 35 Ma) Eocene suggest that, along the eastern margin of the Cordillera, modern elevations had not yet been obtained." ;

    schema:about "Oxygen isotope ratios of authigenic carbonates have long been used as a proxy for those of local precipitation and/or groundwater in terrestrial settings, and these values can in turn be used to study climate and hydrology of the past. The nature of this proxy relation, however, is dependent on the temperature of carbonate formation, which is often assumed to reflect that at the surface. In this study we use clumped isotope ratios of authigenic carbonate from the Paleogene-aged Kootznahoo Formation of Alaska to estimate the temperature of formation and thus provide a more accurate estimate of the oxygen isotope ratio of precipitation that can then be used to investigate past environments. Samples of carbonate cement and spar from the Kootznahoo Formation have carbon and oxygen isotope ratios that fall into two distinct groups. These are interpreted to represent mixing trends between marine and meteoric end-member fluids, with the former having oxygen isotope ratios of approximately -24 and approximately -15 ppm if a formation temperature of 10 degrees C, as has been inferred for high latitudes during the Paleogene, is assumed. Clumped isotope analyses indicate, however, that carbonate formation occurred at high temperatures between approximately 50 and 120 degrees C, and suggest that oxygen isotope ratios of meteoric waters were approximately -14 and approximately -5 ppm for the two sample groups. In general, the large differences in estimated oxygen isotope ratio of precipitation obtained using these different formation temperatures result in a significantly different paleohydrogical and paleoclimatic interpretations of the data. More importantly, this work suggests that it may not always be valid to assume that carbonates formed under surface conditions. The reason for the existence of two distinct groups of isotopic data remains unclear, although it may reflect changes in the global or regional hydrological cycle over time." ;

    schema:about "Sedimentary rocks in the Denver Basin of central Colorado contain a multitude of leaf fossil assemblages that range in age from 69 to 54 Ma. The younger and less abundant of these megafloras are from of the early Eocene \"D2\" sequence of synorogenic sediments, and most of them are constrained to a distinctive paleosol and adjacent arkosic sands near the base of the D2 layer. Most of these floras are relatively understudied compared to older floras, but there are chemostratigraphic data to suggest that the basal paleosols and sands were deposited during the beginning of the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) climatic event. Therefore it is important to describe the nature of the D2 leaf assemblages, and to compare them with PETM floras from other areas. For this study leaves from six leaf sites were morphotyped and described to create a comprehensive database of D2 leaves in the Denver Basin. Paleoclimate data will be calculated using Leaf Margin Analysis and Leaf Size Analysis to determine mean annual temperature and precipitation, respectively during early D2 (and presumably early PETM) time. The Denver Basin Eocene floras will also be compared to published floras of contemporaneous age from the Bighorn Basin, WY and Golden Valley Formation, ND. Such a comparison will hopefully lead to a better understanding of regional climate change and regional vegetation change during the PETM warming event." ;

    schema:about "The Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a rapidly occurring and global interval of climate change, yielded the highest temperatures of the last approximately 80 My. In addition to a global change in temperature, the PETM is thought to have impacted fluvial sedimentation and, by extension, hydrology in terrestrial basins. The goal of this study is to investigate whether such a PETM-sedimentation link exists in the Wind River Basin (WRB) of Wyoming. It is possible to identify the PETM in the rock record because it is coincident with a 2-6ppm negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in terrestrial records. Preliminary carbon isotope data from bulk sedimentary organic matter from the early Cenozoic Indian Meadows and Fort Union Formations in the southeastern part of the WRB identify a approximately 4-5ppm negative CIE. Both the magnitude of this excursion and the absolute carbon isotope ratios of organic matter are consistent with other terrestrial records of the PETM CIE, thus indicating that the PETM is preserved in the WRB. The PETM section in the WRB is associated with a sedimentological transition from organic-rich mudstones to channel sands. Onset of the coarser beds, interpreted as fluvial channel deposits, occur stratigraphically below the CIE onset. One possible explanation for this onset is that this represents sedimentological response driven by climatic change prior to main phase PETM. Alternatively, the CIE onset may be coincident with sedimentological changes observed but effectively masked in the isotope record due to a higher influx of recycled carbon from Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in channel sands. In either case, it seems apparent that the climate change at/near the PETM had a pronounced influence on sedimentology in the Wind River basin." ;

    schema:about "Although the greenhouse world of the Eocene lacked extensive ice sheets, there is ample evidence that climate and the carbon cycle varied regularly in response to short-term orbital forcings, with some changes being quite large (e.g. 'hyperthermals'). What remains uncertain is how small changes in solar insolation that are the basis of these forcings were amplified to have a global impact in an ice-free world. Using a combination of carbon isotope data from authigenic carbonates (provides evidence for methane production took place in Eocene) and incubation experiments using leaf litter (allows estimates of methane production to be made), we suggest that temperature-dependent methane emission from leaf litter at the surface of high-latitude wetlands provides a means of amplifying small temperature changes, and of modifying the carbon budget and carbon isotope ratio of earth surface reservoirs. When methane production rates are scaled to the landscape level, mass-balance modeling indicates that Eocene temperature and carbon isotope changes can be accounted for at orbital timescales, thus supporting a wetland-methane-temperature feedback hypothesis. The Eocene is also characterized by long-term warming leading up to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), and gradual cooling from the EECO to the early Oligocene. It is possible that such temperature changes could also be driven in part by variable methane emissions from high-latitude+ or -other wetlands, with the areal extent of these wetlands playing the critical role as a feedback mechanism. The expectation would be wetland expansion associated with increasing global temperatures, and wetland contraction associated with decreasing temperatures. Although present-day ice cover makes it difficult to map changes in the extent of high-latitude wetlands in detail, a general decrease can be inferred from the EECO to the early Oligocene. Overall this research suggests an intriguing possibility: that methane production in high-latitude wetlands of the greenhouse played a feedback role in the climate system that is analogous to that played by high-latitude ice sheets of the present-day icehouse. Ongoing study of this possibility may lead to a better understanding of the Eocene as well as a better understanding of what a warmer, future world may look like." ;

    schema:about "We estimated annual return rate, fidelity, and breeding dispersal in a migratory population of Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) in central Colorado. Return rates, based on capture-recapture histories of 39 males and 52 females from 1981 to 2003, were higher for males (84%) than for females (45%). Annual recapture probability was higher for females, because breeders are easier to capture than nonbreeders and females always attempted to nest, whereas some males were unpaired (did not nest) for up to four years. Territory fidelity was male biased (92%, vs. 56% for females, adjusted for undetected emigration), and mean tenure on territories was more than twice as long for males as for females. Females, but not males, had lower return rates to territories in the year following nesting failure compared with females whose nests were successful. Most males appeared to occupy one territory their entire reproductive lives, countering predictions of habitat-selection models that individuals should move to higher-quality habitats when they become available. We estimated that 74% of pairs retained the same mate in consecutive nesting attempts, but mates that bred together for multiple years had no reproductive advantages over mates that bred together for the first time. In most cases, females dispersed from territories if their mates did not return. When females dispersed, they went to territories where total productivity over the study and lifetime reproductive success of new mates were higher than on original territories, which supports the hypothesis that dispersal by females increases individual fitness." ;

    schema:about "The Paleogene Chickloon Formation of Alaska is made up of a succession of sand/siltstones, carbonaceous shales, conglomerates, and coals. Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios (delta (super 18) O and delta (super 13) C) of authigenic carbonate from it provide information regarding groundwater hydrology, paleotopography, and carbon dynamics in high-latitude regions during greenhouse climate states. These inferences can be made because authigenic carbonate forms in equilibrium with groundwater, which has a source in surface water, and thus its chemistry provides a proxy for reconstructing surface conditions. This information is important because high-latitude Paleogene terrestrial deposits are rare and thus relatively little is known about these regions. Evidence for groundwater mixing comes in the form of a curvilinear array of delta (super 13) C and delta (super 18) O. This array falls between two hypothetical end-member waters, one associated with anoxic swamp water, and the other with river water. delta (super 18) O of these end-members are influenced by hydrological recharge. Low delta (super 18) O end-member values are associated with fluvial sandstones, and are interpreted to reflect recharge by precipitation falling on highlands adjacent to the Chickaloon depocenter. High delta (super 18) O end-member values are associated with organic-rich mire/swamp deposits, and are interpreted to reflect recharge by precipitation from low elevation air masses. Different delta (super 13) C end-members are interpreted to reflect differences in cycling of surface carbon. Lower delta (super 13) C of the fluvial deposits are consistent with oxidation of organic matter in well-drained soils, while much higher delta (super 13) C (up to +13 ppm) suggest that methane formation took place in anoxic swamps. To get waters with very different delta (super 18) O values, a large topographic feature, such as a mountain range, could have been present in the area. Based on the isotopic data, that range would have had a paleotopographic elevation of a minimum of approximately 2.2 km. In the case of carbon, high delta (super 13) C values like those from the Chickaloon swamp deposits are also found in authigenic carbonate from other high paleolatitude Paleogene strata, suggesting that methane formation may have been an integral part of high latitude terrestrial systems, and that the production of such methane--a powerful greenhouse gas--is one reason for the existence of greenhouse climates during the Paleogene." ;

    schema:about "Because stable isotope ratios of precipitation and temperatures decrease in a regular manner as elevation increases (i.e. approximately uniform lapse-rates are observed), proxies for these variables have the potential to provide information regarding paleoelevation and paleotopography. Application of lapse-rates is most successful when proxy data from a particular time-slice can be compared among a number of localities that follow the presumed trajectory of rising air masses in the past. However, in areas such as the Cordillera of western North America, where air mass trajectories are variable, where post-range front topography is complex, or where multiple air masses with different sources and rainout histories are present, simple lapse-rate interpretations of isotopic and temperature data can be more ambiguous. In an effort to address these problems, we use a global climate model to simulate atmospheric transport, precipitation, temperature, and isotope ratios of precipitation over North America during the early and late Paleogene for a prescribed geography and topography. This approach allows widespread proxy data to be considered in the context of an integrated climatic-atmospheric-topographic framework. The model is then run several times, changing only the topography of western North America (e.g. high-Sevier orogenic belt, low Sevier-orogenic belt, low-Laramide orogenic belt, high-Laramide orogenic belt, etc.). Results of these simulations are somewhat counterintuitive, suggesting the primary control on isotope ratios of precipitation in the Laramide region is the elevation of the Sevier hinterland, and that ratios decrease as the elevation of the hinterland decreases. Proxy data are broadly consistent with model results, although limits in the spatial and temporal resolution of proxy data make it difficult to discriminate among alternative model results." ;

    schema:about "Extensive terrestrial deposits of Late Cretaceous age provide a window into this greenhouse world that has allowed for detailed descriptions of past environments and ecosystems. In western North America for example, low-relief river and floodplain environments were located in basins to the east of Sevier Orogeny highlands and west of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS), with these environments extending north-south from Alaska to Mexico. Living in these river and coastal areas was a very diverse assemblage of plants and animals, including the most diverse dinosaur ecosystems described to date. Despite all that is known about the Late Cretaceous in western North America, there are some critical questions that remain unanswered. Considering climate, there is the question of how floodplains and coastal environments are linked to the global carbon cycle, and what role they play in maintaining greenhouse climate conditions. Focusing on ecosystems, a major question is how these forests were able to support such diverse associations of animals, particularly large herbivorous dinosaurs, given the absence of evidence for migratory behaviors. In this study, stable isotope ratios (delta (super 13) C and delta (super 18) O) of hadrosaurid dinosaur teeth collected from a number of Campanian-aged localities along the WIS are used to investigate these questions. Isotope ratios of tooth dentine are altered by diagenetic processes taking place in soils/sediments, and thus provide information on these processes, including those involving carbon. In contrast, isotope ratios of tooth enamel preserve primary biological signals, and can be used to study animal diets, which in the case of hadrosaurids are trees of the floodplain forest. High delta (super 13) C of dentine (> +5 ppm) indicates that CH (sub 4) production took place in certain soils on the floodplain and that this CH (sub 4) was emitted to the atmosphere. Such emission likely played an important role as a climate feedback that helped maintain greenhouse conditions during the Late Cretaceous. Offsets in delta (super 13) C of enamel for co-existing populations of hadrosaurids, including populations with high delta (super 13) C (> -6 ppm), provide evidence for both dietary niche partitioning and for the recycling of soil-derived carbon by overlying vegetation. In turn, the latter indicates that closed-forest canopies were present on the floodplain." ;

    schema:about "Western North America had two coastlines during the Late Cretaceous, one to the east associated with the Western Interior Seaway (WIS), and one to the west other associated with the Pacific Ocean. Between them was an area of high elevation that formed in response to subduction-related tectonics. Fluvial sediments flowing from the central highlands to the WIS extend from northern Mexico to Alaska, and preserve exceptional records of plant and animal fossils from a relatively short time interval (the late Campanian). Paleoclimatic studies based on paleobotanical and stable isotope proxies provide evidence for higher than modern temperatures and a reduced latitudinal temperature gradient along the coast of the WIS, while climate model simulations suggest highly seasonal precipitation associated with monsoonal atmospheric circulation. What has been absent is any paleoenvironmental information for sites along the Pacific coast, to the west of the Cordillera. As a result, important question regarding the nature of temperature and precipitation patterns to the west of the highlands, and how these conditions may have influenced sedimentation patterns and local ecological patterns remain unanswered. In an effort to answer these questions, we we present carbon and oxygen isotope data from authigenic and biogenic carbonates collected from the Campanian El Gallo Formation of Baja California, Mexico. Initial results indicate that Baja was isotopically distinct from sites to the east of the Cordillera at similar latitudes (in Utah and New Mexico), and was thus characterized by different climatic conditions and perhaps vegetation. Climate model simulations also suggest differences in precipitation patterns, which may in turn relate to different styles of sedimentation between regions. Overall the paleoenvironmental study of Baja provides an excellent point of contrast to the better-known localities along the WIS, and isotopic data and climate model simulations from both areas can ultimately be compared to records from East Asia at similar latitudes." ;

    schema:about "Terrestrial ecosystems of the Late Cretaceous were both complex and fundamentally different than those of the present day. Those occupying wet coastal floodplains of western North America were characterized by a diverse association of vertebrates, including a number of herbivorous dinosaurs, and by plant communities that included a mix of ferns, cycads, conifers and angiosperms. The density and height of vegetation on the landscape, and the role these forest characteristics may have played in supporting these ecosystems, is not well known. In this study, carbon isotope-based proxies are used to study soil processes and to infer forest structure over a late Cretaceous landscape in southern Utah. It is found that methanogenesis took place in water-logged soils and resulted in the formation of CO (sub 2) with very high carbon isotope ratios. Furthermore, vegetation in some parts of the forest was dense enough and tall enough to allow for recycling of this CO (sub 2) into lower canopy leaves. Lastly, carbon isotope ratios of hadrosaurid tooth enamel suggests these animals had variable habitat preferences, and were restricted in their movement. Recognition that methane formation can take place in soils associated with high water tables has paleoclimatic implications, as methane plays an important role in maintaining of hothouse climate conditions. Growth of a mix of open and closed canopy forests in these soils points to the influence of surface hydrology on forest structure. Similarly, the common occurrence of angiosperms in these forests reflects their role in the development of this type of vegetation structure as far back as the late Cretaceous. These forests appear to have provided a wide variety of ecological niches for vertebrates, with some of the larger taxa (e.g. hadrosaurid dinosaurs) having specific habitat preferences." ;

    schema:about "The Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah preserves one of the best records of late Cretaceous plant and animal life in western North America. Sedimentological studies indicate these organisms occupied fluvial landscapes of the Sevier foreland that were low in relief and frequently inundated, while climate model and simulations and oxygen isotope data indicate that monsoonal precipitation was associated with flooding of the landscape. Carbon isotope data from hadrosaur tooth enamel indicates that forest structure varied over these landscapes, with hadrosaurs partitioning resources from a mix of open and closed forest canopies. What remains unknown is detailed surface hydrology of these landscapes, and how surface flooding and subsequent draining varies over small spatial scales and in turn how such variations correspond to differences in forest structure. In this study, oxygen isotope ratios of hadrosaur tooth enamel, fish scales, bivalve shells, pond carbonates and pedogenic carbonates are used to infer the ratio of surface waters over different parts of the paleo-floodplain. Bivalve data indicate there are large rivers recharged by upland precipitation plus varying amounts of lower elevation precipitation, while hadrosaur, fish and pedogenic carbonate data indicate that smaller streams were present that were recharged only by low elevation precipitation. Bivalve, fish and pond micrite data also point to existence of lakes that were recharged by a mix of stream and river water, presumably during seasonal flooding events analogous to those taking place in southeast Asia today. Organic content of sediment and carbon isotope ratios of paleosol carbonate and of hadrosaur dentine from different sites indicate that soils along lake margins were variably saturated, with those closer to the margin being saturated for a longer period of time compared to more distal localities. The more saturated localities are also the ones associated with closed canopy forest structures, which demonstrates the importance of fluvial systems in influencing the distribution of plants over Kaiparowits landscapes." ;

    schema:about "Patterns of movement are a critical component of animal behavior that are in turn related to their biology, diet and ecology, but are hard to infer for extinct organisms such as dinosaurs. Fortunately, stable isotope ratios of vertebrate fossils, in particular tooth enamel, can be used to infer patterns of movement for such organisms. This is possible because oxygen, carbon and strontium isotope ratios of bioapatite that makes up enamel are influenced by the ratios of ingested food and water. In turn, these ratios vary significantly over terrestrial landscapes. For example, oxygen isotope ratios of surface waters decrease as elevation increases, strontium isotope ratios of surface waters flowing over older rocks are higher than those flowing over younger rocks, and carbon isotope ratios of water-stressed plants are higher than those that are not. To date, this type of isotopic approach has been used to study movement of two populations of sauropod dinosaurs that lived on the late Jurassic landscape of North America. Oxygen isotope data indicate that Camarasaurus dinosaurs from Utah and Wyoming migrated hundreds of kilometers each year from the Morrison basin to western highlands. The goal of this study is to expand this research by (1) collecting strontium and carbon isotope data from these same Camarasaurus teeth, (2) collecting oxygen, strontium and carbon isotope data from co-existing Diplodocus and Allosaurus teeth, and (3) by expanding this multi-isotope, multi-taxa approach to include samples from two new sites in Colorado. Preliminary results suggest that the carnivorous Allosaurus from Utah, Wyoming and eastern Colorado followed the west-east, upland-lowland migrations of Camarasaurus, possibly because Camarasaurus was their main food source. In contrast to these localities, there is little evidence that either Camarasaurus or Diplodocus from western Colorado undertook seasonal migrations. This behavior may be explained by the existence of a large lake system in the region that would have made migration unnecessary. Allosaurus from western Colorado appear to have spent time in uplands away from the lake system, but these uplands were the nearby erosional remnants of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rather than active arc-related mountains to the west." ;

    schema:about "There is mounting evidence linking abrupt geomorphic changes to hyperthermal events during the early Paleogene. In terrestrial basins, these geomorphic responses are observed as changes in the stacking patterns and grain size distribution of fluvial sand-bodies, as well as variations in coeval floodplain successions. In western North America, the early Paleogene was also a period of extensive tectonic activity associated with the Laramide Orogeny and resulting basin strata preserve a complex history of both allogenic forcings. This study attempts to deconstruct these effects in the Huerfano Basin. Paleocene-Eocene alluvial deposits of the Poison Canyon and Cuchara formations are exposed along the western basin margin. The Poison Canyon-Cuchara transition is marked by an abrupt shift in fluvial deposition characterized by changes in lithofacies abundance, increased sand-body stacking patterns and channel dimensions, and coarser grain size. Fine-grained overbank facies indicate wetter Paleocene conditions shifting to drier conditions during the Eocene. Our provenance analysis using U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology and sandstone petrography indicates a uniform sediment source from the Wet Mountains for the lower Paleogene succession. A new bulk organic carbon isotope record from this section shows substantial short-term variability throughout the section, but a negative shift of nearly equal 2 ppm that occurs near the Poison Canyon-Cuchara contact. Samples were also analyzed for magnetic susceptibility as well as hysteresis parameters. There is marked change at the Poison Canyon-Cuchara transition in the high and low field magnetic susceptibility as well as magnetic coercively and remanence. Precise biostratigraphic information is lacking in this portion of the section, but grossly constrains the time period as late Paleocene to early Eocene. These datasets show a progression similar to other Laramide basins where patterns are attributed to hydrologic changes during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. In the Huerfano Basin, we hypothesize that climate was a major contributor to the observed stratigraphic patterns. The carbon isotope excursion is broadly consistent with the PETM, but the signal is less distinct and is of a lesser magnitude compared to isotope records in other Laramide basins." ;

    schema:about "The richly fossiliferous Two Medicine (TMF) and Judith River (JRF) Formations of Montana provide an exceptional opportunity to document and compare patterns of fossil diagenesis. Bones and teeth were collected from eight well-documented localities that represent a wide range of lithologies and depositional settings. Sampled paleoenvironments include lacustrine facies from upland and coastal regions, fluvial channel deposits, tidally-influenced channel deposits, and sandy shallow marine facies (shoreface). Authigenic cements in 134 bones and teeth were examined using both polarized light microscopy and SEM-EDS. Rare earth element (REE) concentrations were determined for most of the same samples using LA-ICP-MS. Laser ablation techniques expedited the collection of REE data, and also allowed for the tracking of REE patterns within individual fossils (e.g., marginal enrichment). -- Fossil bones collected from fluvial sandstone bodies in the TMF tend to be pervasively filled by calcite and/or iron oxides. Bones and teeth recovered from nearby lacustrine mudstones typically display detrital clay rinds and are infilled with calcite. Bones from a fine-grained paralic TMF site are characterized by fills of calcite and pyrite, and exhibit significant replacement of bone by these same minerals. In contrast, bones recovered from paralic mudstones of the JRF are generally filled with detrital clay and exhibit a paucity of authigenic cements. Bones preserved in shallow marine sandstones of the JRF show abundant pyritization. With regard to REE, TMF fossils tend to have higher overall concentrations relative to JRF fossils and are more enriched in light REE. REE patterns tend to track paleoenvironments closely, and can be used to readily distinguish among localities in both formations. Finally, overall REE patterns in enamel and dentine are similar within a given tooth, but normalized total REE concentrations vary in these tissues from relatively low (enamel) to relatively high (dentine). This pattern is consistent with porosity and crystallite density contrasts in enamel and dentine, and illustrates the importance of these factors in diagenetic processes." ;

    schema:about "This study reconstructs paleohydrologic conditions across the Campanian foreland basin of Montana using d18 O values from unionid bivalve shells, gar scales, crocodile teeth, and carbonate sediments derived from ancient river, stream, pond, lake, and soil deposits. Samples were obtained from the Two Medicine Formation (up-dip alluvial plain) and coeval Judith River Formation (coastal lowlands). This multi-proxy, multi-depositional environment approach captures d18O variability linked to precipitation histories, catchment structure, biologic behaviors, and taphonomic mixing. Lacustrine carbonates, paleosol carbonate nodules, and unionid bivalves from coastal ponds and up-dip streams display d18O values between -8.32‰ (VPDB) and -10.76‰, interpreted to capture local meteoric precipitation within the basin. In contrast, unionid bivalves from large fluvial sandstones display d18O values near -16.22‰, likely due to high elevation runoff in the Sevier highlands. The d18O of gar scales and crocodile teeth display a proximal-to-distal gradient between the up-dip alluvial plain and coastal lowlands with gar scales ~1.28‰ more negative and crocodile teeth ~4.55‰ more negative on average in the up-dip alluvial plain. We attribute this gradient to a combination of (1) progressive rain out as storm tracks move east to west across the basin and possible monsoonal precipitation, (2) movement of the organisms between aquatic environments, and (3) taphonomic contamination between pond and fluvial sites. Finally, our data document a negative shift in regional d18O values between the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages possibly related to global cooling recorded in the marine realm." ;

    schema:about "This paper examines the political economy of the Orange Revolution in an effort to understand routes by which less democratic postcommunist countries might break with an illiberal status quo. The fusion of Ukraine's rent-seeking economic interests and illiberal political regime produced an unstable equilibrium that is poorly explained by two leading theoretical frameworks: 'market reform' and 'political competition' theory. Only by combining key insights from each do we get a full explanation of the pressures that generated Ukraine's challenge to illiberalism in 2004. We examine this story with a particular focus on the crisis-prone nature of 'competitive authoritarian regimes' and the related strategic calculations of business elites.

    schema:about "We study a class of single-server queueing systems with a finite population size, FIFO queue discipline, and no balking or reneging. In contrast to the predominant assumptions of queueing theory of exogenously determined arrivals and steady state behavior, we investigate queueing systems with endogenously determined arrival times and focus on transient rather than steady state behavior. When arrival times are endogenous, the resulting interactive decision process is modeled as a non-cooperative n-person game with complete information. Assuming discrete strategy spaces, the mixed-strategy equilibrium solution for groups of n = 20 agents is computed using a Markov chain method. Using a 2 x 2 2 between-subject design (private vs. public information by short vs. long service time), arrival and staying out decisions are presented and compared to the equilibrium predictions. The results indicate that players generate replicable patterns of behavior that are accounted for remarkably well on the aggregate, but not individual, level by the mixed-strategy equilibrium solution unless congestion is unavoidable and information about group behavior is not provided." ;

    schema:about "A model of coalition government formation is presented in which inefficient, non-minimal winning coalitions may form in Nash equilibrium. Predictions for five games are presented and tested experimentally. The experimental data support potential maximization as a refinement of Nash equilibrium. In particular, the data support the prediction that non-minimal winning coalitions occur when the distance between policy positions of the parties is small relative to the value of forming the government. These conditions hold in games 1, 3, 4 and 5, where subjects played their unique potential-maximizing strategies 91, 52, 82 and 84 percent of the time, respectively. In the remaining game (Game 2) experimental data support the prediction of a minimal winning coalition. Players A and B played their unique potential-maximizing strategies 84 and 86 percent of the time, respectively, and the predicted minimal-winning government formed 92 percent of the time (all strategy choices for player C conform with potential maximization in Game 2). In Games 1, 2, 4 and 5 over 98 percent of the observed Nash equilibrium outcomes were those predicted by potential maximization. Other solution concepts including iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies and strong/coalition-proof Nash equilibrium are also tested.

    schema:about "We study a class of trust-based cooperation dilemmas that evolve in continuous time. Characteristic of these dilemmas is that as long as all n players continue to cooperate, their payoffs increase monotonically over time. Simultaneously, the temptation to defect increases too, as the first player to defect terminates the interaction and receives the present value of the payoff function whereas each of the other n ? 1 players only receives a proportion delta (0 < delta < 1) of the defecting player's payoff. We introduce a novel experimental institution that we call the Real-Time Trust Game (RTTG) to examine this class of interactions. We then report the results from an iterated RTTG in which the values of n and delta are varied in a between-subjects design. In all conditions, cooperation breaks down in the population over iterations of the game. The rate of breakdown sharply increases as n increases and more slowly decreases as delta increases." ;

To avoid this, leaders must recognize the need to maintain the plurality of belief systems and that the only permissible discrimination is the ability to do a job." ;

    schema:about "In 1988, the United Methodist Church went on record in their opposition to sexual harassment. A study of sexual harassment in the denomination was mandated, and later updated in 2005. This paper discusses some of the findings of that update, focusing on the gender and the clergy/lay status of both perpetrators and victims. Based on 1800 surveys from leaders in the denomination, the study suggests that (1) rates of sexual harassment against women have remained fairly stable, but reports of sexual harassment against men have risen sharply, especially regarding the more ambiguous types of harassment, (2) most perpetrators against both women and men continue to be men, and (3) perpetrators are now found more among the laity than the clergy. Overall, the earlier concern about sexual misconduct by male clergy remains, but the added problem of sexually harassing laity warrants attention. In addition, more research is needed about same-sex sexual harassment (SSSH) in the context of a traditional institution like the church." ;

It is stated that the thoughtful understanding by these framers about the international relations should continue to guide U.S. foreign policy. However, it is also cited that the policies of the administration of the U.S. President George W. Bush wrongly departed from the wise American tradition." ;

Developed under an iterative and incremental agile model, these single-use HTML5 applications target multiple devices while using Bootstrap and Django to deliver fast and responsive interfaces to underlying FRBR datastores running on Redis, an advanced NoSQL database server. Two types are delineated: applications for access and discovery, which are available to everyone; and productivity applications, which are primarily for library staff to administer and manage the FRBR-RDA records. The access portfolio includes Book Search, Article Search, Call Number, and Library Hours applications. The productivity side includes an Orders App and a MARC Batch application for ingesting MARC records as FRBR entities using RDA Core attributes. When a critical threshold is reached, the Tutt Library intends to replace its legacy ILS with this library application portfolio." ;

A more reasonable understanding of the country's true power is that it maintains in abundance the elements whereby to contain and deter threatening actions by hostile regimes." ;

Particular focus is given to the relationship between right of revolution and humanitarian intervention, sometimes called the \"responsibility to protect\" (R2P). Other topics include preventative war and the foreign policy of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln." ;

    schema:about "A field life history study of Mesovelia mulsanti was conducted in southern Illinois, the results of which are compared with those from an earlier study also conducted in southern Illinois. The two studies differed in the collecting techniques used (quadrat sampler versus aquatic net). Results of the present study give a clearer picture of the life history of this insect because the quadrat sampler collected representative samples of nymphs and adults more effectively than the aquatic net and, thus, the quadrat samples more accurately represented the actual chronology of the annual generations." ;

    schema:about "Although the structure of the hammerhead ribozyme is well characterized, many questions remain about its catalytic mechanism. Extensive evidence suggests the necessity of a conformational change en route to the transition state. We report a steric interference modification approach for investigating this change. By placing large 2' modifications at residues insensitive to structurally conservative 2'-deoxy modifications, we hoped to discover structural effects distal to the site of modification. Of twenty residues tested, six were identified where the addition of 2' bulk inhibits cleavage, even though these bulky modifications could be accommodated in the crystal structure without steric clash. It is proposed that these 2'-modifications inhibit cleavage by preventing formation of the alternate, active conformation. Since these 2' effects are present in both domain I and domain II of the hammerhead, the entire catalytic core must undergo conformational changes during catalysis.

    schema:about "The removal of rare or endangered individuals from wild populations for evaluation of genetic composition may have deleterious consequences to these populations. As a viable alternative, we recommend limb removal as a means to obtain tissue for genetic analysis of rare amphipods. The effect of limb amputation on the survival of amphipods has not been previously studied. Our experiments showed that survival of Gammarus troglophilus, a common amphipod of Midwest caves and springs, was similar (p=.74) between control (unmanipulated) and experimental (amputation of I or 2 of the walking legs, pereopods 5 through 7) groups of amphipods. After 42 d, 25 of 26 amphipods in the experimental group had regenerated limbs that were half the size of the original appendage. Post-amputation survival could allow sampling of tissue for genetic analyses without sacrificing individuals, an important asset when working with species that are endangered or for which population sizes are very small." ;

    schema:about "Voltinism in Microvelia hinei was studied in southern Illinois during 1989 and 1990. This species apparently overwintered as adults, which became active in late April; adults were last collected in late September. First instars were found from mid-May to late June, second instars from early-May to late October, third instars from mid-May to mid-July, fourth instars from mid-May to mid-August, and fifth instars from mid-May to mid-August. The sequences of peaks of nymphal instars and adults indicate that this species is at least bivoltine in southern Illinois. This species was reared from egg to adult at 26.7 +/- 0.6degreesC and under a 14L:10D photoperiod. The incubation period averaged 6.41 days; and the five nymphal stadia, 4.28, 2.76, 2.52, 3.00, and 4.08 days, respectively. Total developmental time averaged 25.00 days." ;

The bug also was reared in the laboratory from egg to adult. Adults of this apparently univoltine species overwintered and became active in late January. Copulation was noted occasionally from early March to early June. Eggs were found periodically from mid-February to mid-August and always were glued to moss attached to damp or dry rocks. First through third instars were collected first in early May, fourth instars in early June. Higher percentages of later instars were found as the season progressed. The bug was reared in the laboratory on adults of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen under a 14L: 10D photoperiod at 18.3 +/- 1.5 degrees C. The incubation period averaged 17.4 days. Durations of the four subsequent stadia averaged 8.3, 7.9, 8.5, and 13.1 days, respectively." ;

This vision competed with the notion of a civil society based on the concepts of liberty and property. These concepts were brought to Southern California by the first two governors, Felipe de Neve (1775-82) and Pedro Fages (1782-91). Los Angeles was founded in 1781, a short distance from the San Gabriel Mission. Los Angeles began as a mixture of peoples and principles, and its mestizo quality still characterizes the city." ;

    schema:about "Premise: Prey species may possess inappropriate behavioural, morphological, and/or physiological responses to introduced, novel predators. Thus, introduced predators may exert strong selection on prey species. Organisms: Black-capped vireo, Vireo atricapilla, and the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. Data: Behavioural response of and time-energy budget for parental vireo defence against nest predation by fire ants. Field site: Fort Hood, Texas, an 88,500-hectare US military installation. Results: Fire ants usually attacked vireo nests near midnight as parents slept. All attacked nests - whether with eggs or nestlings - failed. However, adults defended their nests vigorously. Nest defence was prolonged, with a mean duration of 7.7 +/- 1.5 hours (25 times longer than that against native snake predators). Compared with brooding or incubation, nest defence is energetically expensive, depleting an estimated 59% of fat stores. Conclusions: Fire ants are effective nest predators on this low-nesting bird species. The behavioural response of vireos to this novel predator is wholly inappropriate, with no benefits and considerable costs. Besides the energetic costs, defence results in numerous bites and venomous stings. Vireos ought to abandon their nests when first attacked by fire ants." ;

    schema:about "In both psychology and philosophy, cognitive theories of emotion have met with increasing opposition in recent years. However, this apparent controversy is not so much a gridlock between antithetical stances as a critical debate in which each side is being forced to qualify its position in order to accommodate the other side of the story. Here, I attempt to sort out some of the disagreements between cognitivism and its rivals, adjudicating some disputes while showing that others are merely superficial. Looking at evidence from neuroscience and social psychology, as well as thought experiments and theoretical arguments, I conclude that it is necessary to acknowledge both that emotions have intentional content and that they involve somatic agitation. I also point out some of the more promising directions for future research in this area." ;

    schema:about "A new supplemented concept of the genus Traegaardhia Zacharda, 1980 (Acari: Rhagidiidae) is presented and descriptions of seven new species of the genus are given. These are Traegaardhia cavernarum n. sp., T. cavernicola n. sp., T. distosolenidia n. sp., T. gracilis n. sp., T. nasuta n. sp., T. subterranea n. sp., from caves located in northeastern Prealps, Italy, and T. similis n. sp. from the Ozark Plateaus, southeastern USA. The neotype of Foveacheles holsingeri Zacharda, 1980 is assigned, the species is redescribed and together with Foveacheles paralleloseta Zacharda, 1985, transferred into the genus Traegaardhia. Foveacheles thaleri n. sp. is described as the possible epigean ancestor of the derivative troglobiotic T. subterranea and the adaptive shift hypothesis and parapatric speciation of T. subterranea is outlined. A key to adults of the known eleven species of the genus Traegaardhia is presented. The biogeography, morphological adaptations to life in caves (troglomorphisms), vicariance and distribution of the presented taxa are briefly discussed. All new taxa are authored by M. Zacharda only." ;

According to the author, memory and imagination refers to only one thing based on the meaning given by author Thomas Hobbes. The author also aimed to correct other authors' mispresentation of Fairchild as a poet of memory. The author stressed that Fairchild is far more thoughtful, far more complicated writer than many critics have yet understood. He is a philosophical poet embodying his ideas in narratives about a variety of people." ;

    schema:about "The Western Slimy Salamander (Plethodon albagula) in central Texas is known from both surface and cave environments. Threshold species, such as P. albagula, may be excellent candidates to study potential differences in life-history traits during the evolutionary transition from surface into subterranean habitats. We conducted a 29-mo mark-recapture study of a surface and a cave population in Bell County, Texas, USA, to determine whether these populations differed in body size, growth rate, age at sexual maturity, and life span. We employed a growth model to estimate growth rate, age at sexual maturity, and life span, and an open population model to estimate population size, density, catchability, and survival rates. Salamanders were smaller on average and reached a smaller maximum size in the surface population compared to the cave population, which was skewed toward larger, older individuals. Growth trajectories were similar between populations, but the cave population reached sexual maturity faster (0.9-1.4 y) than the surface population (1.5-2.2 y). Survival rates were similar between populations. Although population size estimates were 10 times higher for the surface compared to the cave population, densities were similar between sites suggesting that habitat availability alone could explain population size differences. Plethodon albagula exhibits plasticity in growth, body size, and development, which may be adaptive and a function of extreme variation in surface environmental conditions. Subterranean habitats may be important for the long-term persistence of local populations, which may persist for years in subterranean habitats." ;

In the article, Lunsford and Lunsford presented research that showed little change in the overall frequency of formal error in student writing over a 20-year period. Describing it as the most comprehensive examination of error in student writing in 20 years, the writers contend that the research of Lunsford and Lunsford debunks the misconception that students no longer care about the surface elements of their writing." ;

    schema:about "Essay collections frequently employed in US composition courses can be an awkward fit when applied to the teaching of writing outside US academic culture. In similar fashion, peer tutor training manuals employed in US writing centers rest on assumptions about academic writing and writing center practice which are grounded in American academic culture. In particular, the processes and foci of Anglo-American and Continental writing display significant differences in terms of both epistemology and practice. An increasingly international writing center practice demands elucidation of theory and practice which might best facilitate the work of new tutors and better conform to local academic practices and needs." ;

    schema:about "This paper examines the impact of public health insurance programs, whether structured as subsidies to health care providers (public hospitals and uncompensated care reimbursement funds) or as direct insurance (Medicaid) on the purchase of private health insurance. The presence of a public hospital is associated with a lower likelihood of private insurance for those with incomes between 100-200% and 200-400% of the poverty level. Uncompensated care reimbursement funds were associated with less purchase of private health insurance and a higher likelihood of being uninsured across all income groups. More generous Medicaid programs showed both safety-net and crowd out effects.

    schema:about "The Highway Trust Fund in the US was established to maintain and expand the national system of highways. The fund has long been financed through excise taxes on motor fuel. In 1978 the Federal Government began subsidising ethanol use through motor fuel tax relief. By subsidising ethanol markets in this way, the Federal Government has linked these two separate programmes. This paper analyses data from 1980-1996 to estimate the extent to which the ethanol promotion subsidies have had unintended feedback effects upon the appropriations from the highway trust fund. A general model of the fund disbursement process is estimated, and the results are used to simulate disbursements under an alternative regime where ethanol subsidies are not taken from the fund. The results suggest that there have been significant and differential transfers of wealth across states because of this choice of policy instrument. The results also suggest that significant free-riding is occurring because states lose funds regardless of whether they use ethanol. Most importantly, linking the trust fund to the federal desire to subsidise the ethanol market has redistributed significant amounts of trust fund money independent of any changes in state highway need. The results highlight how overlaying an environmental subsidy onto an existing earmarked tax programme can have detrimental feedback effects on the operation of the trust fund.

    schema:about "There are two interrelated acyl-homoserine lactone quorum-sensing-signaling systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These systems, the LasR-LasI system and the RhiR. RhlI system, are global regulators of gene expression. We performed a transcriptome analysis to identify quorum-sensing-controlled genes and to better understand quorum-sensing control of P. aeruginosa gene expression. We compared gene expression in a LasI-RhlI signal mutant grown with added signals to gene expression without added signals, and we compared a LasR-RhlR signal receptor mutant to its parent. In all, we identified 315 quorum-induced and 38 quorumrepressed genes, representing about 6% of the P. aeruginosa genome. The quorum-repressed genes were activated in the stationary phase in quorum-sensing mutants but were not activated in the parent strain. The analysis of quorum-induced genes suggests that the signal specificities are on a continuum and that the timing of gene expression is on a continuum (some genes are induced early in growth, most genes are induced at the transition from the logarithmic phase to the stationary phase, and some genes are induced during the stationary phase). In general, timing was not related to signal concentration. We suggest that the level of the signal receptor, LasR, is a critical trigger for quorum-activated gene expression. Acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing appears to be a system that allows ordered expression of hundreds of genes during P. aeruginosa growth in culture.

    schema:about "This paper investigates three modes in which the European-Asian encounter was pictured in circa 1600. First, Netherlandish printed images of the potential fruits of Asian and American trade are explored. In the frontispiece to Abraham Ortelius' 1579 Theatrum Orbis Terraum atlas, we find five continents pictured as nymphs surrounding a columned gateway, with the European nymph seated at the top, African and Asian nymphs at the sides, and South American and Tierra del Fuego at the bottom. The Tierra del Fuego nymph is only pictured as a bust, since, as the accompanying text explains, she has not yet been fully crafted or known. Images of Portuguese Goa reveal various forms of Dutch critique of Portuguese colonial practices. Finally, European-Asian encounters as pictured in Japanese painted screens of the same period are explored. About thirty sets of Japanese namban folding screens from about 1580 to 1610 reveal Portuguese traders and missionaries disembarking at Nagasaki, and parading to the Jesuit compound there. This paper argues that the format of parading with gifts is adapted from earlier Chinese images of Central Asians bearing tribute gifts to the Chinese court. It is interesting that the Japanese rulers are here appropriating the role of the \"central kingdom\" traditionally assigned to China. Furthermore, a classicizing motif is again used to suggest the empowered position of the home culture. The paper concludes by considering theatricality, and the worldwide flow of goods, as common elements across these imageries.

Using a dynamic model of patenting, we find robust empirical support for the hypothesis, concluding that both the acquisition cost and retail markup portion of fuel prices are powerful in generating subsequent innovation. Our results include the effects of CAFE regulations, finding no evidence of their impact on innovation, even within a model that endogenizes them via fuel price expectations." ;

    schema:about "This article describes a study assessing the impact of reference services on undergraduate students. The study targeted undergraduates receiving nondirectional reference assistance, yielding sixty-nine survey responses and five follow-up interviews. Three outcomes were examined: (1) Do undergraduate students perceive the reference staff as being friendly and approachable? (2) Do they learn something during the course of the reference interaction? and (3) Do they feel more confident about their ability to find information after the reference interaction than they did before? Our findings suggest that reference services can play a significant role in helping students become confident, independent information seekers. Correlations between variables and a multiple regression model further indicate that friendliness of the reference staff was one of the best predictors of students' confidence in their ability to find information on their own. These outcomes are particularly salient in a college and university environment where building skills for independent information exploration is a primary goal.

    schema:about "A NE-SW trending, steeply-dipping shear zone in the southern gneiss terrain of the southern Bighorn Mountains of north-central Wyoming may be a foreland thrust-fault related to the Oregon Trail structural belt (OTSB) of the Granite Mountains, approximately 150 km to the south. Preliminary U-Pb apatite dates (450 degrees C cooling dates) document unroofing of the southern Bighorn Mountains during the Archean, ca. 2.65 Ga, coeval with movement on the OTSB. U-Pb dates of syntectonic sphene collected from a sheared mafic dike suggest the Powder River Pass shear zone developed at ca. 2.64 Ga. Microstructures analyzed in thin-section exhibit a strong fabric, syntectonic growth of sphene, and sub-grain rotation of feldspar. Both sigma and delta-augens analyzed from hand-sample suggest a south-side up sense of movement. An alternative model of south-side up bulk tilting of the basement without movement on a discrete fault will be tested by high temperature thermal histories on either side of the fault through U-Pb dating of apatite. The OTSB transects the Granite Mountains, an east-west trending uplift in south-central Wyoming and is interpreted as a deformation front related to continent-arc collisions ca. 2.65-2.62 Ga. This study provides important insights into the tectonic evolution of the Wyoming province and southern Bighorn Mountains during the Neoarchean approximately 2.65 Ga and may lead to better tectonic models for thick-skinned basement uplifts associated with continent-arc collisions." ;

    schema:about "Abstract Section 112(m) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, referred to as the Great Waters Program, mandated an assessment of atmospheric deposition of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) to Lake Champlain. Mercury (Hg) was listed as a priority HAP and has continued to be a high priority for a number of national and international programs. An assessment of the magnitude and seasonal variation of atmospheric Hg levels and deposition in the Lake Champlain basin was initiated in December 1992 which included event precipitation collection, as well as collection of vapor and particle phase Hg in ambient air. Sampling was performed at the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill Center, VT. The range in the annual volume-weighted mean concentration for Hg in precipitation was 7.8–10.5 ng/l for the 11-year sampling period and the average amount of Hg deposited with each precipitation event was 0.10 µg/m2. The average amount of Hg deposited through precipitation each year from 1993 to 2003 was 9.7 µg/m2/yr. A seasonal pattern for Hg in precipitation is clearly evident, with increased Hg concentrations and deposition observed during spring and summer months. While a clear trend in the 11-year event deposition record at Underhill was not observed, a significant decrease in the event max-to-monthly ratio was observed suggesting that a major source influence was controlled over time. Discrete precipitation events were responsible for significant fractions of the monthly and annual loading of Hg to the forested ecosystem in Vermont. Monthly-averaged temperatures were found to be moderately correlated with monthly volume-weighted mean Hg concentrations (r2=0.61) and Hg deposition (r2=0.67) recorded at the Vermont site. Meteorological analysis indicated the highest levels of Hg in precipitation were associated with regional transport from the west, southwest, and south during the warmer months.

    schema:about "Thoreau's journal contains a number of passages which explore the nature of perception, developing a response to skeptical doubt. The world outside the human mind is real, and there is nothing illusory about its perceived beauty and meaning. In this essay, I draw upon the work of Stanley Cavell (among others) in order to frame Thoreau's reflections within the context of the skeptical questions he seeks to address. Value is not a subjective projection, but it also cannot be perceived without the appropriate kind of emotional orientation or attunement toward the world: that is, an attitude of trust or acceptance. Without this affective receptivity, or \"perceptual faith,\" our knowledge of reality is limited. The beliefs we hold onto in the face of objective uncertainty establish the framework within which we make particular evaluations, and in this sense they are a necessary condition of practical reason. Every understanding has its mood." ;

    schema:about "Gmelch's (1974) claim that professional athletes were more superstitious during difficult tasks than easy tasks was tested in a golf putting experiment. Forty college students, 26 male and 14 female, of varying golfing abilities, were tested in 20 easy putts from 3 feet, and 20 difficult putts from 9 feet. Using four colored balls, superstitious behavior was defined as selecting the same colored ball after a made putt, consistent with the methodology of Van Raalte, Brewer, Nemeroff, and Under (1991). Skill level was assessed by a median split of total putts made. There was a significant interaction between level of putt difficulty and skill level on superstitious behavior. Low skill participants were more superstitious in the easy putting task than the difficult putting task, and high skill participants were more superstitious in the difficult putting task than the easy putting task. Gmelch's claims were supported by the high skill participants' behavior and may be explained by the uncertainty hypothesis. The low skill participants' behavior did not support Gmelch's claims, and may be better explained by the reciprocal nature of learned helplessness and superstitious behavior.

    schema:about "The dipteran Drosophila melanogaster can express a form of reproductive quiescence or diapause when exposed to low temperature and shortened photoperiod. Among natural populations in the eastern United Stales, the frequency of lines that express reproductive diapause in the laboratory varies substantially and predictably with latitudinal origin. The goals of the present study were twofold: (1) to examine the impact of genetic variance for diapause expression on multiple traits associated with organismal fitness; and (2) to evaluate the potential for fitness trade-offs between diapause and nondiapause phenotypes that may result in the observed cline. Even prior to diapause entry or expression, inbred lines that express and do not express reproductive diapause in laboratory assays were constitutively distinct for life span, age-specific mortality rates, fecundity profiles, resistance to cold and starvation stress, lipid content, development time, and egg-to-adult viability. Furthermore, estimates of genetic correlations based on line means revealed significant differentiation for genetic variance/covariance matrices between diapause and nondiapause lines. The data indicate the potential for life history trade-offs associated with variation for the diapause phenotype. The observed cline in diapause incidence in the eastern United States may be generated by these tradeoffs and the associated spatial and/or temporal variation in relative fitness of these two phenotypes in natural populations.

    schema:about "Tamarix ramosissima has caused dramatic morphological changes to riparian ecosystems and their bank structures over the last century throughout the southwestern United States. Growing as either small trees or dense stands of shoots, Tamarix species displace or actively outcompete native species of willow (Salix exigua) and cottonwood (Populus deltoides) on the Arkansas River in Colorado. Under normal conditions for colonization by native species, Tamarix seedlings are at a great competitive disadvantage due to slow above ground biomass accumulation. However, damming and the resulting altered disturbance regime may give Tamarix an advantage over native species. Damming on the Arkansas River, Colorado, dramatically reduces the intensity and recurrence interval of downstream flooding. Using two dams in eastern Colorado as proxies for flood control, we assessed physiological, demographic and abiotic factors in order to understand how flooding and damming might influence riparian community dynamics. Our study demonstrates that drought and salinity stress may influence native species recruitment and survival in areas with reduced flooding. Moreover, Tamarix water-use may be quite plastic in drought conditions, suggesting that it conserves water at below dam sites.

    schema:about "glp-1 encodes a member of the highly conserved LIN-12/Notch family of receptors that mediates the mitosis/meiosis decision in the C. elegans germline. We have characterized three mutations that represent a new genetic and phenotypic class of glp-1 mutants, glp-1(Pro). The glp-1(Pro) mutants display gainof-function germline pattern defects, most notably a proximal proliferation (Pro) phenotype. Each of three glp-1(Pro) alleles encodes a single amino acid change in the extracellular part of the receptor: two in the LIN-12/Notch repeats (LNRs) and one between the LNRs and the transmembrane domain. Unlike other previously described gain-of-function mutations that affect this region of LIN-12/Notch family receptors, the genetic behavior of glp-1(Pro) alleles is not consistent with simple hypermorphic activity. Instead, the mutant phenotype is suppressed by wild-type doses of glp-1. Moreover. a trans-heterozygous combination of two highly penetrant glp-1(Pro) mutations is mutually suppressing. These results lend support to a model for a higher-order receptor complex and/or competition among receptor proteins for limiting factors that are required for proper regulation of receptor activity. Double-mutant analysis with suppressors and enhancers of lin-12 and glp-1 further suggests that the functional defect in glp-1(Pro) mutants occurs prior to or at the level of ligand interaction.

    schema:about "Although cigarette manufacturers were aware of the addictive properties of nicotine as early as 1962, the information did not become available to the US public until 1979 when the Surgeon General disclosed it (US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1979). This study simulates the impact this information would have had on the demand for cigarettes had it been released in 1962. The simulations build on past work by Fenn et al. (2001) who found evidence that the release of addiction information resulted in a structural shift in demand in 1979. In the present study, the econometric results from Fenn et al. (2001) are used to compute simulated time paths for state-level per capita consumption under the hypothetical scenario involving the earlier release of the addiction information. Using these simulated consumption paths; the projected reductions in cigarette sales revenue are calculated. These dollar figures provide a benchmark against which to judge the compensation amounts that the industry must pay because of recent tobacco lawsuit settlements." ;

The authors present upper bounds for both measures that are constructed using actual playing schedules. They model competitive balance as a function of player talent, the incidence of strikes, the expansion of the NFL, change in the number of playoff teams, schedule length, team relocation, the number of new stadiums, and the introduction of free agency and the salary cap in the NFL using data from the 1970 to 2002 seasons. The authors find that free agency and salary cap restrictions tend to promote competitive balance, whereas a concentration of player talent reduces competitiveness among teams. Player strikes and the construction of new stadiums also affect competitive balance. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

This paper provides an initial empirical test of market power for the NFL during the 1995 to 1999 seasons. We employ the price-cost margin methods under constant returns to scale as outlined by Neumann and Haid (1985) and Martin (1988). The two-stage least squares estimates, which control for the endogeneity of the price-cost margin and attendance as a percentage of total capacity, suggest that market power exists for the NFL during the 1995 to 1999 seasons." ;

Tradition is neither the only nor the highest moral standard in the 'Analects'. Instead, Confucius uses the Dao, as manifested in personal and social harmony, to evaluate individual traditions and select moral models." ;

Instrumentalist approaches hold that environmental value derives from human interests, whereas intrinsic value approaches hold that animals, plants, or ecosystems have value in their own right. Both approaches have limitations: the first fails to capture certain kinds of value, and grounds for the second approach are elusive. Drawing on the idea of the relational self in Chinese philosophy, we sketch an alternative approach to environmental ethics. We argue that the natural world plays a role in constituting human identities and that this can be an important source of environmental value." ;

To overcome this difficulty, researchers have utilized data from Professional sports.

Unfortunately, the abundance itself may pose a problem, as researchers face a number of plausible measurements of worker performance. As we show, the choice of measurements does impact the results. Additionally, we show that race can also be measured in a variety of Ways and that :Choice also appears to influence; the reported findings. Such results indicate that prior research on the topic of racial discrimination may need to be reconsidered." ;

    schema:about "Understudied volcanoes may provide valuable insight about tectonic setting, regional trends, and evolution of magma sources. Subduction along the Middle American Trench offshore Costa Rica has produced numerous volcanoes, many of which, like the Tenorio volcanic complex, are unstudied. Recent fieldwork within the Tenorio Complex in NW Costa Rica, has identified three distinct volcanoes, from south to north: Tenorio, Montezuma, and Carmela. In the field flows are distinguished by weathering intensity. The extent of weathering will be quantified using open system mass balance calculations, assuming Ti immobility. Field investigations suggest a northward migration of the volcanic center. Compositions shift from andesite in the south to basaltic andesite in the north. Andesite flows from Volcan Tenorio contain labradorite (An57-68), cpx, hyp, opaques, and rare olivine phenocrysts set in an andesitic groundmass, primarily andesine (An49) and display disequilibrium and trachtyic textures. Basaltic andesite flows from Cerro Montezuma contain calcic labradorite (An64), cpx, hpy, opaques, and rare olivine phenocrysts in a plagioclase rich groundmass and include glomerporphyritic clots of olivine and pyroxene. Basaltic andesite flows from Cerro Carmela contain labradorite (An54-68), cpx, hyp, opaques, and a trace of olivine phenocrysts. The total content of alkalis versus SiO2 (59.73% Tenorio, 53.04% Montezuma and 58.11% Carmela), and the ratio of Zr/TiO2 vs. Nb/Y classify Volcan Tenorio flows as an andesite and Cerro Montezuma and Cerro Carmela as basaltic andesites. On TiO2-MnO*10-P2O5*10 ternary diagram samples cluster as transitional between island arc tholeiitic and calc-alkaline basalt. However, on FeO+Fe2O3+TiO2-Al2O3-MgO and FeO*-Alk-MgO diagrams, samples fall into a calc-alkalic suite. The tectonic setting, arc-basalt, is shown on Zr/117-Th-Nb/16, Ti/100-Zr-Y*3, Hf/3-Th-Nb/16, and Nb*2-Zr/4-Y ternary diagrams. Spider diagrams plotted against NMORB show a trough at Nb, typical of subduction zones. Also found in the NMORB spider diagram is a Ba enrichment and a spike at the Pb, consistent with crustal contamination. REE spider plots show 100x enrichment in LREE and contain no Eu anomaly. Analysis of the complex suggests an arc setting with a mantle source and crustal contamination." ;

    schema:about "Lava flows of the intraplate Miocene Akaroa Volcanic Complex (AVC), Banks Peninsula, New Zealand, display a cyclical geochemical trend from picrite to benmoreite. When observed within a single stratigraphic section, flows reveal repeating patterns, or batches, of primitive to evolved magmas. Primitive flows are generally porphyritic, while the more evolved flows are consistently aphyric. Previous studies have led to a model for the AVC in which a deep reservoir (lithospheric detachment sourced) fed and replenished multiple shallow magma chambers, which then fractionated individually to produce several independently evolving magma batches. The purpose of this research is to test that model and extend it spatially across the eastern flanks of the AVC, as well as to characterize magma chamber dynamics using geochemistry and petrography. Sixty-nine samples were taken from six stratigraphically controlled transects across the eastern AVC for XRF analysis. Based on rock type and composition, samples were separated into individual batches within their respective transects. Distinct geochemical variations were observed in samples ranging from 43-59 wt.% SiO (sub 2) , 0.5-7 wt.% MgO, 1-4 wt.% TiO (sub 2) , and 0-270 ppm V. The distinction between batches were drawn where element concentrations varied significantly within stratigraphy, further supported by petrographic distinctions (plagioclase resorbtion and sieved cores, and skeletal textures). By correlating the crystallinity and textures of each flow with the bulk-rock geochemistry, we argue that the shallow magma chambers underlying the AVC experienced cycles of magma evolution punctuated by magmatic recharge from depth. As each batch evolved, the phenocrysts would settle in the chamber forming a crystal mush while the residual evolved liquid erupted. With further magma replenishment this crystal mush was incorporated into the eruptives, resulting in the initial, most primitive flow(s) of each cycle to contain the greatest degree of crystallinity, along with resorbtion and sieve textures in the phenocrysts. The phenocrysts contained within these early batch flows are essentially antecrysts in that they are inherited from an earlier melt." ;

Using \"M2W conversion sites\" -- former military lands recently redesignated as U.S. national wildlife refuges -- as a case study, we examine how the restoration of these lands challenges existing philosophical frameworks for restoration. We argue that a contextual, case-based analysis best reveals the key ethical and philosophical questions related to restoration at M2W sites, and that such an approach may be useful in developing more nuanced philosophical analyses of ecological restoration more generally." ;

    schema:about "The widely-heralded arrival of the \"Anthropocene\" era seems to call the existence and value of the natural world into question. Is the world prior to human alteration of it something worth preserving? Can and should we attempt to restore ecological conditions prior to human disturbance? Ecological restoration has traditionally used the past as a reference point in establishing standards and assessing the value of restored landscapes. In many landscapes, however, the traditional notion of historical fidelity provides inadequate guidance because contemporary and future social, ecological, or climate contexts differ, or will differ, radically from those that historically prevailed. Thus, some scholars recommend that we move toward restoration that looks to the future instead of the past. Others propose a \"narrative ethics\" that accounts for the past while allowing a place to evolve in ways that fit its unfolding story. Both futuristic and narrative approaches to restoration accommodate change and acknowledge a role for social values. However, both have been criticized as overly anthropocentric, and neither is strongly action guiding. Using examples of restoration at former military sites, I consider how we might develop an ethics of ecological restoration that acknowledges change while taking account of the past ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

    schema:about "In professional sports teams that win games consistently do well financially. Over the years, profits have motivated professional sports teams to search for good players. In their pursuit of wins, teams have recruited talented players regardless of their race or national origin. This paper examines the effects of hiring a diverse set of players on team success in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The effects of employee heterogeneity on team performance are tested using panel data from the 2002-2008 NBA seasons. This paper shows the benefits and problems associated with employing a geographically diverse workforce in the NBA. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a measure of market power, is adapted to measure team diversity. Win percentages of teams are regressed against their HHIs and other control variables such as player talent and coaching expertise. The results show that increases in diversity as measured by the HHI and international player's minutes lead to higher win percentages for their teams.

    schema:about "Xenophon's programmatic preface to his narrative of the revolution at Thebes (Hellenica 5.4.1) in 378 B.C.E. suggests that the author positions the stasis there as an interpretive model for the larger contemporary wars over mainland hegemony, similar to Thucydides with Corcyra. Accordingly, the abuses of the Spartan-backed government at Thebes and the resentment that these provoke provide a blueprint for understanding the broader disintegration of support for Sparta's hegemony in the period before Leuctra. However, Sparta's contrastingly fair resolution of a stasis at Phlius and the enduring loyalty that this engenders further provided Xenophon with the opportunity to introduce an alternative paradigm of benevolent hegemony.

    schema:about "Engagement, Withdrawal, and Social Reform: Confucian and Contemporary Perspectives Marion Hourdequin Concern with social and moral reform plays an important thematic role in the Analects, and the text discusses a number of possible responses to a morally failing society. This essay offers an account of engagement, withdrawal, and social reform in the Analects, then places the issue of social reform in a contemporary context through a comparative and critical discussion of the Analects and the book Habits of the Heart, by Robert Bellah et al. It is argued that Confucius rejects the option of complete withdrawal from society, even where such withdrawal aims to preserve personal moral integrity. However, Confucius also cautions against deep involvement with corrupt regimes and suggests that reformers must withdraw from particular institutions when moral engagement is impossible within them. The recommendations found in Habits of the Heart strikingly parallel many of those in the Analects, particularly in emphasizing individual engagement and reinvigoration of tradition as sources of social renewal. Although traditions require critical examination in contemporary contexts, the idea-found in both texts-that engagement in social reform can benefit the reformer as well as society more broadly remains important and relevant today." ;

It is vital to examine parks and conservation critically to identify places where they are exacerbating resource struggles that often result from globalization and development, in the United States and in other countries. This article uses Foucauldian discourse analysis to identify conflicting discourses present in this conflict and to analyze knowledge and power in relation to issues of resource and land use in protected areas. This analysis highlights differences in scale and logic between the discourse used by local stakeholders, and the discourse used by conservation organizations and Park officials, in the Point Reyes conflict and in other National Parks" ;

    schema:about "The Goodeniaceae, close relatives of the Asteraceae, are a conspicuous part of the flora of Australia and many islands in the Pacific. A comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family using cpDNA regions trnL-F and matK is presented, including representatives of all genera and nearly half the species. The family resolves into the two large clades: 'LAD' (Lechenaultia, Anthotium, Dampiera) and 'Core Goodeniaceae' (Brunonia, Scaevola, Diaspasis, Coopernookia, Goodenia, Selliera, Velleia, Verreauxia, Pentaptilon), which are also supported by morphological characters. The former Brunoniaceae, comprising the single species Brunonia australis, is clearly placed within the Goodeniaceae as sister to the remainder of Core Goodeniaceae while possessing many autapomorphic characteristics. Current subgeneric taxonomic groups are partially supported as monophyletic within Goodenia and Dampiera, but are generally non-monophyletic within Lechenaultia and Scaevola. Fruit types and floral traits involved in pollination and adaptations to aridity have evolved in a highly convergent fashion within several major clades. Rates of molecular evolution and number of extant taxa differ at several points between sister clades, particularly between Brunonia and the rest of Core Goodeniaceae, and between Scaevoia s.l. and Goodenia s.l. Future taxonomic changes will involve the synonymization of Selliera and monotypic Diasposis and, pending more comprehensive taxon and molecular sampling, the large, paraphyletic genus Goodenia may be split into at least three genera." ;

    schema:about "The recent stagnation of electronic commerce highlights the need to understand contemporary online consumer behavior. E-commerce's slow growth has coincided with an explosion in the usage of Web 2.0 activities. These novel online venues have created many new channels for online retailers to reach buyers, yet these online activities have gone largely unstudied. This study incorporates current user demographics and Web 2.0 activities to dynamically model the determinants of two key measurements of recent online shopping, a recent purchase and the novel dependent variable, percentage of income spent online. Regression analysis is applied to a nationally representative 2007 survey of the U.S. online population. Determinants of a recent online purchase include, ownership of a credit card, PayPalTM account, listening to podcasts, participating in online auctions, and for the first time, female gender. In a second regression, positive determinants for the percentage of income spent online include male gender, educational attainment, online auctions, instant messaging, and online dating. Online spending increases with time online, and appears to compete with other forms of online entertainment and social networking. These results produce snapshots of contemporary online shoppers that can be used by electronic retailers to determine which product characteristics to highlight for greatest impact, and to efficiently target specific Web 2.0 activities, such as entertainment, podcast and social network websites, to develop new and robust marketing platforms." ;

    schema:about "Mercury is a global toxin that can be introduced to ecosystems through atmospheric deposition. Mercury oxidation is thought to occur in the free troposphere by bromine radicals, but direct observational evidence for this process is currently unavailable. During the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks campaign, we measured enhanced oxidized mercury and bromine monoxide in a free tropospheric air mass over Texas. We use trace gas measurements, air mass back trajectories, and a chemical box model to confirm the origin and chemical history of the sampled air mass. We find the presence of elevated oxidized mercury to be consistent with oxidation of elemental mercury by bromine atoms in this subsiding upper tropospheric air mass within the subtropical Pacific High, where dry atmospheric conditions are conducive to oxidized mercury accumulation. Our results support the role of bromine as the dominant oxidant of mercury in the upper troposphere." ;

    schema:about "The crustal structure of north-central Wyoming records a history of complex lithospheric evolution from Precambrian accretion to Cretaceous-Paleogene Laramide shortening. We present two active source P wave velocity model profiles collected as part of the Bighorn Arch Seismic Experiment in 2010. Analyses of these velocity models and single-fold reflection data, together with potential field modeling of regional gravity and magnetic signals, constrain crustal structure and thickness of the Bighorn region. We image a west dipping reflection boundary and model a sharp magnetic contact east of the Bighorn Arch that together may delineate a previously undetected Precambrian suture zone. Localized patches of a high-velocity, high-density lower crustal layer (the 7.x layer) occur across the study area but are largely absent beneath the Bighorn Arch culmination. Moho topography is relatively smooth with no large-scale offsets, with depths ranging from similar to 50 to 37km, and is largely decoupled from Laramide basement topography. These observations suggest that (1) the edge of the Archean Wyoming craton lies just east of the Bighorn Mountains, approximately 300km west of previous interpretations, and (2) Laramide deformation localized in an area with thin or absent 7.x layer, due to its relatively weak lower crust, leading to detachment faulting. Our findings show that Precambrian tectonics in northern Wyoming may be more complicated than previously determined and subsequent Laramide deformation may have been critically dependent on laterally heterogeneous crustal structure that can be linked to Precambrian origins." ;

    schema:about "Knowledge of the local state of stress is critical in appraising intraplate seismic hazard. Inverting earthquake moment tensors, we demonstrate that principal stress directions in the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) differ significantly from those in the surrounding region. Faults in the NMSZ that are incompatible with slip in the regional stress field are favorably oriented relative to local stress. We jointly analyze seismic velocity, gravity, and topography to develop a 3-D crustal and upper mantle density model, revealing uniquely dense lower crust beneath the NMSZ. Finite element simulations then estimate the stress tensor due to gravitational body forces, which sums with regional stress. The anomalous lower crust both elevates gravity-derived stress at seismogenic depths in the NMSZ and rotates it to interfere more constructively with far-field stress, producing a regionally maximal deviatoric stress coincident with the highest concentration of modern seismicity. Moreover, predicted principal stress directions mirror variations (observed independently in moment tensors) at the NMSZ and across the region. Abstract Copyright (2016), .

    schema:about "In coastal rivers, tidal pumping enhances the exchange of oxygen-rich river water across the sediment-water interface, controlling nitrogen cycling in riverbed sediment. We developed a one-dimensional, fluid flow and solute transport model that quantifies the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal and applied it to the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ) of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA). In field observations and models, both oxygenated river water and anoxic groundwater deliver nitrate to carbon-rich riverbed sediment. A zone of nitrate removal forms beneath the aerobic interval, which expands and contracts over daily timescales due to tidal pumping. At high tide when oxygen-rich river water infiltrates into the bed, denitrification rates decrease by 25% relative to low tide. In the absence of tidal pumping, our model predicts that the aerobic zone would be thinner, and denitrification rates would increase by 10%. As tidal amplitude increases toward the coast, nitrate removal rates should decrease due to enhanced oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface, based on sensitivity analysis. Denitrification hot spots in TFZs are more likely to occur in less permeable sediment under lower tidal ranges and higher rates of ambient groundwater discharge. Our models suggest that tidal pumping is not efficient at removing surface water nitrate but can remove up to 81% of nitrate from discharging groundwater in the TFZ of White Clay Creek. Given the high population densities of coastal watersheds, the reactive riverbeds of TFZs play a critical role in mitigating new nitrogen loads to coasts.

    schema:about "A tear in the subducting Nazca slab is located between the end of the Pampean flat slab and normally subducting oceanic lithosphere. Tomographic studies suggest mantle material flows through this opening. The best way to probe this hypothesis is through observations of seismic anisotropy, such as shear wave splitting. We examine patterns of shear wave splitting using data from two seismic deployments in Argentina that lay updip of the slab tear. We observe a simple pattern of plate-motion-parallel fast splitting directions, indicative of plate-motion-parallel mantle flow, beneath the majority of the stations. Our observed splitting contrasts previous observations to the north and south of the flat slab region. Since plate-motion-parallel splitting occurs only coincidentally with the slab tear, we propose mantle material flows through the opening resulting in Nazca plate-motion-parallel flow in both the subslab mantle and mantle wedge." ;

    schema:about "Objectives: Von Economo neurons (VENs) are defined by their thin, elongated cell body and long dendrites projecting from apical and basal ends. These distinctive neurons are mostly present in anterior cingulate (ACC) and fronto-insular (FI) cortex, with particularly high densities in cetaceans, elephants, and hominoid primates (i.e., humans and apes). This distribution suggests that VENs contribute to specializations of neural circuits in species that share both large brain size and complex social cognition, possibly representing an adaptation to rapidly relay socially-relevant information over long distances across the brain. Recent evidence indicates that unique patterns of protein expression may also characterize VENs, particularly involving molecules that are known to regulate gut and immune function. Methods: In this study, we used quantitative stereologic methods to examine the expression of three such proteins that are localized in VENs-activating-transcription factor 3 (ATF3), interleukin 4 receptor (IL4R alpha), and neuromedin B (NMB). We quantified immunoreactivity against these proteins in different morphological classes of ACC layer V neurons of hominoids. Results: Among the different neuron types analyzed (pyramidal, VEN, fork, enveloping, and other multipolar), VENs showed the greatest percentage that displayed immunostaining. Additionally, a higher proportion of VENs in humans were immunoreactive to ATF3, IL4Ra, and NMB than in other apes. No other ACC layer V neuron type displayed a significant species difference in the percentage of immunoreactive neurons. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that phylogenetic variation exists in the protein expression profile of VENs, suggesting that humans might have evolved biochemical specializations for enhanced interoceptive sensitivity.

    schema:about "The structure of the hippopotamus brain is virtually unknown because few studies have examined more than its external morphology. In view of their semiaquatic lifestyle and phylogenetic relatedness to cetaceans, the brain of hippopotamuses represents a unique opportunity for better understanding the selective pressures that have shaped the organization of the brain during the evolutionary process of adaptation to an aquatic environment. Here we examined the histology of the cerebral cortex of the pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) by means of Nissl, Golgi, and calretinin (CR) immunostaining, and provide a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural and volumetric dataset of the anatomy of its brain. We calculated the corpus callosum area/brain mass ratio (CCA/BM), the gyrencephalic index (GI), the cerebellar quotient (CQ), and the cerebellar index (CI). Results indicate that the cortex of H. liberiensis shares one feature exclusively with cetaceans (the lack of layer IV across the entire cerebral cortex), other features exclusively with artiodactyls (e.g., the morphologiy of CR-immunoreactive multipolar neurons in deep cortical layers, gyrencephalic index values, hippocampus and cerebellum volumetrics), and others with at least some species of cetartiodactyls (e.g., the presence of a thick layer I, the pattern of distribution of CR-immunoreactive neurons, the presence of von Economo neurons, clustering of layer II in the occipital cortex). The present study thus provides a comprehensive dataset of the neuroanatomy of H. liberiensis that sets the ground for future comparative studies including the larger Hippopotamus amphibius.

    schema:about "Although neocortical neuronal morphology has been documented in the adult giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) and African elephant (Loxodonta africana), no research has explored the cortical architecture in newborns of these species. To this end, the current study examined the morphology of neurons from several cortical areas in the newborn giraffe and elephant. After cortical neurons were stained with a modified Golgi technique (N = 153), dendritic branching and spine distributions were analyzed by using computer-assisted morphometry. The results showed that newborn elephant neurons were considerably larger in terms of all dendritic and spine measures than newborn giraffe neurons. Qualitatively, neurons in the newborns appeared morphologically comparable to those in their adult counterparts. Neurons in the newborn elephant differed considerably from those observed in other placental mammals, including the giraffe, particularly with regard to the morphology of spiny projection neurons. Projection neurons were observed in both species, with a much larger variety in the elephant (e.g., flattened pyramidal, nonpyramidal multipolar, and inverted pyramidal neurons). Although local circuit neurons (i.e., interneurons, neurogliaform, Cajal-Retzius neurons) resembled those observed in other eutherian mammals, these were usually spiny, which contrasts with their adult, aspiny equivalents. Newborn projection neurons were smaller than the adult equivalents in both species, but newborn interneurons were approximately the same size as their adult counterparts. Cortical neuromorphology in the newborn giraffe is thus generally consistent with what has been observed in other cetartiodactyls, whereas newborn and adult elephant morphology appears to deviate substantially from what is commonly observed in other placental mammals.

    schema:about "The dopaminergic innervation of the striatum has been implicated in learning processes and in the development of human speech and language. Several lines of evidence suggest that evolutionary changes in dopaminergic afferents of the striatum may be associated with uniquely human cognitive and behavioral abilities, including the association of the human-specific sequence of the FOXP2 gene with decreased dopamine in the dorsomedial striatum of mice. To examine this possibility, we quantified the density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive axons as a measure of dopaminergic innervation within five basal ganglia regions in humans, great apes, and New and Old World monkeys. Our results indicate that humans differ from nonhuman primate species in having a significant increase in dopaminergic innervation selectively localized to the medial caudate nucleus. This region of the striatum is highly interconnected, receiving afferents from multiple neocortical regions, and supports behavioral and cognitive flexibility. The medial caudate nucleus also shows hyperactivity in humans lacking a functional FOXP2 allele and exhibits altered dopamine concentrations in humanized Foxp2 mice. Additionally, striatal dopaminergic input was not altered in chimpanzees that used socially learned attention-getting sounds versus those that did not. This evidence indicates that the increase in dopamine innervation of the medial caudate nucleus in humans is a species-typical characteristic not associated with experience-dependent plasticity. The specificity of this increase may be related to the degree of convergence from cortical areas within this region of the striatum and may also be involved in human speech and language.

    schema:about "Despite extensive investigations of the neocortex in the domestic cat, little is known about neuronal morphology in larger felids. To this end, the present study characterized and quantified the somatodendritic morphology of neocortical neurons in prefrontal, motor, and visual cortices of the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). After neurons were stained with a modified Golgi technique (N = 194), dendritic branching and spine distributions were analyzed using computer-assisted morphometry. Qualitatively, aspiny and spiny neurons in both species appeared morphologically similar to those observed in the domestic cat. Although the morphology of spiny neurons was diverse, with the presence of extraverted, inverted, horizontal, and multiapical pyramidal neurons, the most common variant was the typical pyramidal neuron. Gigantopyramidal neurons in the motor cortex were extremely large, confirming the observation of Brodmann ([1909] Vergleichende Lokalisationlehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues. Leipzig, Germany: J.A. Barth), who found large somata for these neurons in carnivores in general, and felids in particular. Quantitatively, a MARSplines analysis of dendritic measures differentiated typical pyramidal neurons between the Siberian tiger and the clouded leopard with 93% accuracy. In general, the dendrites of typical pyramidal neurons were more complex in the tiger than in the leopards. Moreover, dendritic measures in tiger pyramidal neurons were disproportionally large relative to body/brain size insofar as they were nearly as extensive as those observed in much larger mammals (e.g., African elephant). Comparison of neuronal morphology in a more diverse collection of larger felids may elucidate the comparative context for the relatively large size of the pyramidal neurons observed in the present study.

    schema:about "Cholinergic innervation of the basal ganglia is important in learning and memory. Striatal cholinergic neurons integrate cognitive and motivational states with behavior. Given these roles, it is not surprising that deficits in cortical cholinergic innervation have been correlated with loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Such evidence suggests the potential significance of subcortical cholinergic innervation in the evolution of the human brain. To compare humans with other closely related primates, the present study quantified axons and interneurons immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in regions of the executive and motor loops of the basal ganglia of humans, great apes, and monkeys. We also compared ChAT-immunoreactive (ir) interneuron morphological types among species within striatal regions. The results indicate that humans and great apes differ from monkeys in having a preponderance of multipolar ChAT-ir interneurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen, whereas monkeys have a more heterogeneous representation of multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar interneurons. Cholinergic innervation, as measured by axon and interneuron densities, did not differ across species in the medial caudate nucleus. Differences were detected in the dorsal caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus but the observed variation did not associate with the phylogenetic structure of the species in the sample. However, combining the present results with previously published data for dopamine revealed a unique pattern of innervation for humans, with higher amounts of dopamine compared with acetylcholine in the striatum. Taken together, these findings indicate a potential evolutionary shift in basal ganglia neurotransmission in humans that may favor increased synaptic plasticity. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc." ;

    schema:about "The amygdala is a medial temporal lobe structure implicated in social and emotional regulation. In typical development (TD), the amygdala continues to increase volumetrically throughout childhood and into adulthood, while other brain structures are stable or decreasing in volume. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the amygdala undergoes rapid early growth, making it volumetrically larger in children with ASD compared to TD children. Here we explore: (a) if dendritic arborization in the amygdala follows the pattern of protracted growth in TD and early overgrowth in ASD and (b), if spine density in the amygdala in ASD cases differs from TD from youth to adulthood. The amygdala from 32 postmortem human brains (7-46 years of age) were stained using a Golgi-Kopsch impregnation. Ten principal neurons per case were selected in the lateral nucleus and traced using Neurolucida software in their entirety. We found that both ASD and TD individuals show a similar pattern of increasing dendritic length with age well into adulthood. However, spine density is (a) greater in young ASD cases compared to age-matched TD controls (<18 years old) and (b) decreases in the amygdala as people with ASD age into adulthood, a phenomenon not found in TD. Therefore, by adulthood, there is no observable difference in spine density in the amygdala between ASD and TD age-matched adults (18 years old). Our findings highlight the unique growth trajectory of the amygdala and suggest that spine density may contribute to aberrant development and function of the amygdala in children with ASD." ;

    schema:about "Gigantopyramidal neurons, referred to as Betz cells in primates, are characterized by large somata and extensive basilar dendrites. Although there have been morphological descriptions and drawings of gigantopyramidal neurons in a limited number of species, quantitative investigations have typically been limited to measures of soma size. The current study thus employed two separate analytical approaches: a morphological investigation using the Golgi technique to provide qualitative and quantitative somatodendritic measures of gigantopyramidal neurons across 19 mammalian species from 7 orders; and unbiased stereology to compare the soma volume of layer V pyramidal and gigantopyramidal neurons in primary motor cortex between 11 carnivore and 9 primate species. Of the 617 neurons traced in the morphological analysis, 181 were gigantopyramidal neurons, with deep (primarily layer V) pyramidal (n=203) and superficial (primarily layer III) pyramidal (n=233) neurons quantified for comparative purposes. Qualitatively, dendritic morphology varied considerably across species, with some (sub)orders (e.g., artiodactyls, perissodactyls, feliforms) exhibiting bifurcating, V-shaped apical dendrites. Basilar dendrites exhibited idiosyncratic geometry across and within taxonomic groups. Quantitatively, most dendritic measures were significantly greater in gigantopyramidal neurons than in superficial and deep pyramidal neurons. Cluster analyses revealed that most taxonomic groups could be discriminated based on somatodendritic morphology for both superficial and gigantopyramidal neurons. Finally, in agreement with Brodmann, gigantopyramidal neurons in both the morphological and stereological analyses were larger in feliforms (especially in the Panthera species) than in other (sub)orders, possibly due to specializations in muscle fiber composition and musculoskeletal systems." ;

    schema:about "Under climate change, shrubs encroaching into high altitude plant communities disrupt ecosystem processes. Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. Overlap in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated Polemonium. To ascertain whether Salix interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing." ;

    schema:about "In coastal rivers, tides can propagate for tens to hundreds of kilometres inland beyond the saltwater line. Yet the influence of tides on river-aquifer connectivity and solute transport in tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) is largely unknown. We estimate that along the TFZ of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA), 11% of river water exchanges through tidal bank storage zones. Additional hyporheic processes such as flow through bedforms likely contribute even more exchange. The turnover length associated with tidal bank storage is 150 km, on the order of turnover lengths for all hyporheic exchange processes in non-tidal rivers of similar size. Based on measurements at a transect of piezometers located 17 km from the coast, tides exchange 0.36 m3 of water across the banks and 0.86 m3 across the bed per unit river length. Exchange fluxes range from -1.66 to 2.26 m day-1 across the bank and -0.84 to 1.88 m day-1 across the bed. During rising tide, river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer, and the downstream transport rate in the channel is low. During falling tide, stored groundwater is released to the river, and the downstream transport rate in the channel increases. Tidal bank storage zones may remove nutrients or other contaminants from river water and attenuate nutrient loads to coasts. Alternating expansion and contraction of aerobic zones in the riparian aquifer likely influence contaminant removal along flow paths. A clear need exists to understand contaminant removal and other ecosystem services in TFZs and adopt best management practices to promote these ecosystem services.

    schema:about "Abstract: An understanding of surface and subsurface water contributions to streamflow is essential for accurate predictions of water supply from mountain watersheds that often serve as water towers for downstream communities. As such, this study used the end-member mixing analysis technique to investigate source water contributions and hydrologic flow paths of the 264 km2 Boulder Creek Watershed, which drains the Colorado Front Range, USA. Four conservative hydrochemical tracers were used to describe this watershed as a 3 end-member system, and tracer concentration reconstruction suggested that the application of end-member mixing analysis was robust. On average from 2009 to 2011, snowmelt and rainwater from the subalpine zone and groundwater sampled from the upper montane zone contributed 54%, 22%, and 24% of the annual streamflow, respectively. These values demonstrate increased rainwater and decreased snow water contributions to streamflow relative to area-weighted mean values derived from previous work at the headwater scale. Young water (2.3 ??0.8 months) fractions of streamflow decreased from 18?22% in the alpine catchment to 8?10% in the lower elevation catchments and the watershed outlet with implications for subsurface storage and hydrological connectivity. These results contribute to a process-based understanding of the seasonal source water composition of a mesoscale watershed that can be used to extrapolate headwater streamflow generation predictions to larger spatial scales.

In the present study, two PID groups, one with cognitive impairment (PD + Cl; n = 26) and one without cognitive impairment (PD; n = 45), and three control groups of older adults were compared on measures of depressive symptomatology. The control groups included a physically disabled group (n = 46), a cognitively impaired group (Cl; n = 21), and a healthy group (n = 50). Confirmatory factor analysis verified a four-factor model of depressive symptoms (Cognitive, Mood, Somatic, and Fatigue symptoms). Comparisons revealed that the PD group had a depressive-symptom pattern that was not significantly different from the disabled and healthy groups, The PD + Cl group had a symptom pattern that was more similar to the Cl group than to the PD group, Implications for the conceptualization of depression in older adults are discussed.

    schema:about "The debate over access to medicines has principally centered on pharmaceutical patents and prohibitively high drug prices. Although a less recognized problem, counterfeit pharmaceuticals are certainly a more insidious barrier to access. Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is an invisible threat, not only by nature, but also because the industry has historically downplayed it. However, that has changed. Pharmaceutical firms now not only readily concede counterfeiting is a threat to their business, but in some cases publicly address their strategies and the anticounterfeiting technologies in use and development. Acknowledging the problem has benefited the industry because it alters the ways in which firms are able to combat counterfeiting, allowing them to more overtly confront the problem. In addition, it allows them to better partner with governments and health advocates since their incentives are aligned in efforts to prevent counterfeiting. In light of the more public and more aggressive campaign against counterfeiting, it is important to examine the variety of strategies firms may utilize to prevent their sale. Through a theoretical model of the market in a representative developing country, several anticounterfeiting strategies are considered. Some strategies appear to be more effective than others in the battle against fake drugs. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

    schema:about "Although pharmaceutical counterfeiting incidents can be traced back thousands of years, it has been downplayed and even dismissed by pharmaceutical manufacturers in the past. That has changed. Pharmaceutical firms are newly dedicated to eradicate counterfeits globally and spending more money on anticounterfeiting efforts than ever before. The confluence of three factors seems to have drastically changed the existing paradigm for the pharmaceutical industry: increasing globalization, advancing technology, and the controversies surrounding the WTO Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and access to medicines. Given that counterfeit pharmaceuticals slip into the supply chain at every link, multinational pharmaceutical firms are searching for global solutions through increased interfirm cooperation along the supply chain. This research presents a theoretical model for characterizing the implications of these interventions on the motivations driving counterfeiters. The interventions are shown to increase the share of real pharmaceuticals and decrease the welfare losses attributable to counterfeiting. In practice, it is too early to evaluate the success of these new measures, but this research reflects on the extent of cooperation both across the supply chain and national boundaries and examines the likely long-run implications of these measures.

Well-preserved topo-type material from the classic Parahio Valley section is described for three species that have not previously been illustrated photographically. A biostratigraphical scheme based on Cambrian brachiopod occurrence is integrated with that recently proposed for trilobites. Regional correlations based on shared taxa within and across Himalayan lithotectonic belts demonstrate that erosion of Cambrian rocks in the Kurgiakh orogeny in the Parahio Valley removed little of the Parahio Formation and that all of the fossil-bearing lithotectonic zones share similar late early Cambrian brachiopods, suggesting regional faunal continuity at the time. Palaeobiogeographical analysis of the Cambrian brachiopod faunas from the Himalaya shows that they occupied a marginal position of the Australasian segment of Gondwana." ;

    schema:about "The central question in research on linguistic relativity, or the Whorfian hypothesis, is whether people who speak different languages think differently. The recent resurgence of research on this question can be attributed, in part, to new insights about the ways in which language might impact thought. We identify seven categories of hypotheses about the possible effects of language on thought across a wide range of domains, including motion, color, spatial relations, number, and false belief understanding. While we do not find support for the idea that language determines the basic categories of thought or that it overwrites preexisting conceptual distinctions, we do find support for the proposal that language can make some distinctions difficult to avoid, as well as for the proposal that language can augment certain types of thinking. Further, we highlight recent evidence suggesting that language may induce a relatively schematic mode of thinking.

We utilize a 155-country panel framework to present new evidence that financial liberalization is related to reallocation of financial capital around the world. More specifically, we find that deregulation is associated with greater stocks of cross-border financial assets, overall net international indebtedness, and a net portfolio characterized by equity assets and debt liabilities." ;

The Drosophila ortholog of sup-26, alan shepard (shep), is expressed throughout the nervous system and has been shown to regulate neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis. Here, we extend these studies to show that sup-26 and shep are required for the development of diverse cell types within the nematode and fly nervous systems during embryonic and larval stages. We ascribe roles for sup-26 in regulating dendrite number and the expression of genes involved in mechanosensation within the nematode peripheral nervous system. We also find that in Drosophila, shep regulates dendrite length and branch order of nociceptive neurons, regulates the organization of neuronal clusters of the peripheral nervous system and the organization of axons within the ventral nerve cord. Taken together, our results suggest that shep/sup-26 orthologs play diverse roles in neural development across animal species. Moreover, we discuss potential roles for shep/sup-26 orthologs in the human nervous system." ;

To this end, the current study provides the first documentation of neuronal morphology in frontal and occipital regions of the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Cortical tissue from the perfusion-fixed brains of two free-ranging African elephants was stained with a modified Golgi technique. Neurons of different types (N = 75), with a focus on superficial (i.e., layers II-III) pyramidal neurons, were quantified on a computer-assisted microscopy system using Neurolucida software. Qualitatively, elephant neocortex exhibited large, complex spiny neurons, many of which differed in morphology/orientation from typical primate and rodent pyramidal neurons. Elephant cortex exhibited a V-shaped arrangement of bifurcating apical dendritic bundles. Quantitatively, the dendrites of superficial pyramidal neurons in elephant frontal cortex were more complex than in occipital cortex. In comparison to human supragranular pyramidal neurons, elephant superficial pyramidal neurons exhibited similar overall basilar dendritic length, but the dendritic segments tended to be longer in the elephant with less intricate branching. Finally, elephant aspiny interneurons appeared to be morphologically consistent with other eutherian mammals. The current results thus elaborate on the evolutionary roots of Afrotherian brain organization and highlight unique aspects of neural architecture in elephants." ;

    schema:about "The present quantitative study extends our investigation of cetartiodactyls by exploring the neuronal morphology in the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) neocortex. Here, we investigate giraffe primary visual and motor cortices from perfusion-fixed brains of three subadults stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Neurons (n = 244) were quantified on a computer-assisted microscopy system. Qualitatively, the giraffe neocortex contained an array of complex spiny neurons that included both \"typical\" pyramidal neuron morphology and \"atypical\" spiny neurons in terms of morphology and/or orientation. In general, the neocortex exhibited a vertical columnar organization of apical dendrites. Although there was no significant quantitative difference in dendritic complexity for pyramidal neurons between primary visual (n = 78) and motor cortices (n = 65), there was a significant difference in dendritic spine density (motor cortex > visual cortex). The morphology of aspiny neurons in giraffes appeared to be similar to that of other eutherian mammals. For cross-species comparison of neuron morphology, giraffe pyramidal neurons were compared to those quantified with the same methodology in African elephants and some cetaceans (e.g., bottlenose dolphin, minke whale, humpback whale). Across species, the giraffe (and cetaceans) exhibited less widely bifurcating apical dendrites compared to elephants. Quantitative dendritic measures revealed that the elephant and humpback whale had more extensive dendrites than giraffes, whereas the minke whale and bottlenose dolphin had less extensive dendritic arbors. Spine measures were highest in the giraffe, perhaps due to the high quality, perfusion fixation. The neuronal morphology in giraffe neocortex is thus generally consistent with what is known about other cetartiodactyls." ;

    schema:about "The present study documents the morphology of neurons in several regions of the neocortex from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the North Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Golgi-stained neurons (n = 210) were analyzed in the frontal and temporal neocortex as well as in the primary visual and primary motor areas. Qualitatively, all three species exhibited a diversity of neuronal morphologies, with spiny neurons including typical pyramidal types, similar to those observed in primates and rodents, as well as other spiny neuron types that had more variable morphology and/or orientation. Five neuron types, with a vertical apical dendrite, approximated the general pyramidal neuron morphology (i.e., typical pyramidal, extraverted, magnopyramidal, multiapical, and bitufted neurons), with a predominance of typical and extraverted pyramidal neurons. In what may represent a cetacean morphological apomorphy, both typical pyramidal and magnopyramidal neurons frequently exhibited a tri-tufted variant. In the humpback whale, there were also large, star-like neurons with no discernable apical dendrite. Aspiny bipolar and multipolar interneurons were morphologically consistent with those reported previously in other mammals. Quantitative analyses showed that neuronal size and dendritic extent increased in association with body size and brain mass (bottlenose dolphin < minke whale < humpback whale). The present data thus suggest that certain spiny neuron morphologies may be apomorphies in the neocortex of cetaceans as compared to other mammals and that neuronal dendritic extent covaries with brain and body size." ;

Approximately 90% of humans exhibit a right-hand preference, and the vast majority shows left-hemisphere dominance for language function. Although genetic models of human handedness and language have been proposed, the actual gene expression differences between cerebral hemispheres in humans remain to be fully defined. In the present study, gene expression profiles were examined in both hemispheres of three cortical regions involved in handedness and language in humans and their homologues in rhesus macaques: ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal cortex (STC), and primary motor cortex. Although the overall pattern of gene expression was very similar between hemispheres in both humans and macaques, weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed gene co-expression modules associated with hemisphere, which are different among the three cortical regions examined. Notably, a receptor-enriched gene module in STC was particularly associated with hemisphere and showed different expression levels between hemispheres only in humans." ;

    schema:about "Disturbances affect almost all terrestrial ecosystems, but it has been difficult to identify general principles regarding these influences. To improve our understanding of the long-term consequences of disturbance on terrestrial ecosystems, we present a conceptual framework that analyzes disturbances by their biogeochemical impacts. We posit that the ratio of soil and plant nutrient stocks in mature ecosystems represents a characteristic site property. Focusing on nitrogen (N), we hypothesize that this partitioning ratio (soil N: plant N) will undergo a predictable trajectory after disturbance. We investigate the nature of this partitioning ratio with three approaches: (1) nutrient stock data from forested ecosystems in North America, (2) a process-based ecosystem model, and (3) conceptual shifts in site nutrient availability with altered disturbance frequency. Partitioning ratios could be applied to a variety of ecosystems and successional states, allowing for improved temporal scaling of disturbance events. The generally short-term empirical evidence for recovery trajectories of nutrient stocks and partitioning ratios suggests two areas for future research. First, we need to recognize and quantify how disturbance effects can be accreting or depleting, depending on whether their net effect is to increase or decrease ecosystem nutrient stocks. Second, we need to test how altered disturbance frequencies from the present state may be constructive or destructive in their effects on biogeochemical cycling and nutrient availability. Long-term studies, with repeated sampling of soils and vegetation, will be essential in further developing this framework of biogeochemical response to disturbance." ;

In this research, we investigate the psychological reality of such a format, using simulated motion during scene processing?previously linked to schematization?as a diagnostic. One group of participants wrote a verbal description of a scene and then completed a change detection task assessing simulated motion, while another group completed only the latter task. We expected that effects of simulated motion would be stronger following language use than not, and specifically following the use of spatial, relative to non-spatial, language. Both predictions were supported. Further, the effect of language was scene independent, suggesting that language may encourage a general mode of schematic construal.

    schema:about "Tropical conservation and research focus primarily on protected areas and often ignore conservation values of surrounding agricultural lands. Understanding how species utilize agricultural land will maximize conservation efforts. We compared bird community composition in four habitats in northeastern Costa Rica: shade-grown cacao, live fences, riparian forest buffers, and preserved late-successional rainforest. Point counts over 2 months found 167 species from 36 families. Rainforest contained the most species unique to a habitat although richness per point was lower than in agricultural habitats. Half, 31, of the rainforest species did not occur in other habitats, while 106 species, mostly those preferring open areas, occurred in agroforest habitats but not rainforest. While agricultural habitats had fairly similar species composition to each other as determined by distance in an ordination, each also contained significant numbers, 9-30, of unique species. While intact rainforest remains central to conservation of tropical birds, agricultural lands with substantial trees, e.g., live fences, riparian buffers, and plantations with shade trees, can support a high richness of birds. These avian communities are not simply subsets of the rainforest species but include substantial numbers of unique species. Conservation contributions of these lands to species richness and complexity should be considered in conservation, and trees in these habitats preserved." ;

    schema:about "Several decades of research in alpine ecosystems have demonstrated links among the critical zone, hydrologic response, and the fate of elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Less research has occurred in mid-elevation forests, which may be important for retaining atmospheric N deposition. To explore the fate of N in the montane zone, we conducted plot-scale experimental rainfall events across a north-south transect within a catchment of the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory. Rainfall events mimicked relatively common storms (20-50% annual exceedance probability) and were labeled with N-15-nitrate () and lithium bromide tracers. For 4 weeks, we measured soil-water and leachate concentrations of Br-, and daily, followed by recoveries of N-15 species in bulk soils and microbial biomass. Tracers moved immediately into the subsurface of north-facing slope plots, exhibiting breakthrough at 10 and 30 cm over 22 days. Conversely, little transport of Br- or occurred in south-facing slope plots; tracers remained in soil or were lost via pathways not measured. Hillslope position was a significant determinant of soil N-15- recoveries, while soil depth and time were significant determinants of N-15 recovery in microbial biomass. Overall, N-15 recovery in microbial biomass and leachate was greater in upper north-facing slope plots than lower north-facing (toeslope) and both south-facing slope plots in August; by October, N-15 recovery in microbial N biomass within south-facing slope plots had increased substantially. Our results point to the importance of soil properties in controlling the fate of N in mid-elevation forests during the summer season." ;

For hyperbolic G, it is known that is bounded above by , which is known to be finite. For CAT(0) G, the latter quantity is also known to be finite, so one approach is to try proving a similar inequality. So far those efforts have failed. Motivated by these questions we work toward understanding the relationship between large scale dimension of CAT(0) groups and small scale dimension of the group's boundary by shifting attention to the linearly controlled dimension of the boundary. To do that, one must choose appropriate metrics for the boundaries. In this paper, we suggest two candidates and develop some basic properties.

    schema:about "In many cities of the global North, city leaders are using greening as a way to compete in the globalized economy. Critiques of this development strategy typically focus on downtown areas, and many have noted that such processes often displace poor and working class people. Less studied are those areas that have not been fully incorporated into the postindustrial economy and where the struggles around social justice, economic development, and ecological restoration are still being played out. It is this insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this paper seeks to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact of the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South Seattle as case studies, this paper draws on previously unreported qualitative data to argue that community efforts to promote environmental justice in these areas have the potential to redefine practices of green economic growth to incorporate social equity and community coherence. However, their ability to do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging neoliberal discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening to benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the implications of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both developed and developing countries." ;

    schema:about "The consequences of intersectoral factor immobility for optimal monetary policy are examined in a \"New Open Economy Macroeconomics\" framework. When labor cannot be reallocated between tradable and nontradable goods production, this rigidity generates a welfare loss, which increases as the sectors become more different. When prices are predetermined, the model becomes a monetary \"specific factor\" model. Intersectoral factor immobility complicates the optimal monetary policy problem by creating a tradeoff between stabilizing tradable and nontradable sector labor. When labor is mobile between sectors, policy coordination can significantly reduce labor volatility. When it is not mobile, coordination results in less volatility in tradable sector labor, but increased nontradable sector labor volatility." ;

    schema:about "Comments on the book, Political Emotions by Martha C. Nussbaum (2014). This book is a contribution to political philosophy and, simultaneously, a moral-psychological study of the emotions. Political Emotions is a remarkably successful book that combines several areas of philosophical research in which the author's proficiency is well known. It shows how problems that lie on the more intimate side of ethics, pertaining for instance to friendship and family life, have relevance for social justice and public culture; along the way, it also incorporates insightful readings of literary texts. For the sake of this book symposium, I concentrate mainly upon how human emotions are depicted and explained in Political Emotions, and on what Nussbaum's latest work reveals about her considered view about the nature of emotion. Her theory of emotion gets things right in the most important respects if, as she says, 'all my qualifications are taken duly into account'. Yet it would be a useful emendation if she could add one further qualification, by openly articulating a point that is already hinted at in Political Emotions.

    schema:about "Using survey data from Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients in Madison County, New York, we evaluate the effectiveness of the EITC in improving the economic well-being of low-income households. In particular, we examine the impact of the EITC across household types. For tax years 2002 through 2004, we find that the EITC is responsible for significantly lowering the poverty rate of EITC recipients, from 57 to 49%. In fact, for households below the poverty line, the EITC fills 31% of the gap between their adjusted gross income and the poverty line. The EITC has the largest impact on single parent households, lowering their poverty rate by 11.2 percentage points and reducing their poverty gap by almost 35%. However, the EITC has negligible effects on the poorest households in the sample-childless singles. A majority (64%) of EITC recipients intends to use at least some of the refund on basic needs and almost half plan on using part of their refund for debt repayment. This suggests that the EITC helps the majority of recipients get by but does not increase their economic mobility. Somewhat surprisingly, single parent households in the sample are not that different from married parent households in terms of EITC amounts, poverty rates, use of credit, and participation in government programs, despite earning less.

    schema:about "In his discourses on 'the lily of the field and the bird of the air,' Kierkegaard presents faith as the best possible response to our precarious and uncertain condition, and as the ideal way to cope with the insecurities and concerns that his readers will recognize as common features of human existence. Reading these discourses together, we are introduced to the portrait of a potential believer who, like the 'divinely appointed teachers'aEuro\"the lily and the bird-succeeds in leading a life that is full of care, but free of worry. Such a portrait, we claim, echoes Kierkegaard's portrait of the knight of faith in Fear and Trembling. In this essay we suggest that faith, as characterized in the 'lily and bird' discourses, is a kind of existential trust that would allow us to overcome worry, while remaining wholeheartedly engaged in the finite realm of our cares and concerns. We claim that Kierkegaard's goal in these discourses is not to belittle our earthly cares, but to invite us to develop a modified attitude toward all that we are susceptible to worry about." ;

    schema:about "Much attention has recently been paid to comparative work in the public and private sectors looking at work values, motivations, and the impact of government reform movements in organizations. Several studies have compared the public and private sectors in the dimension of values; but none have questioned the popular assumption that nonprofit and public managers share the same or a similar set of values or the value expectations they have for each other. This paper reports on the results of an empirical survey of public and nonprofit managers that compares their individual democratic, ethical, and professional values. In brief, the results lend strong support to the assumption that nonprofit employees share the same value set as their public sector counterparts; but their value sets do have statistically significant differences in the perceived level of importance of altruism, generosity, and individualism." ;

    schema:about "This paper explores the limitations of epistemic scientism for understanding the role the concept of race plays in assisted reproductive technology (ART) practices. Two major limitations centre around the desire to use scientific knowledge to bring about social improvement. In the first case, undue focus is placed on debunking the scientific reality of racial categories and characteristics. The alternative to this approach is to focus instead on the way the race idea functions in ART practices. Doing so reveals how the race idea (1) helps to define the reproductive \"problems\" different groups of women are experiencing and to dictate when and how they should be \"helped\"; (2) helps to resolve tensions about who should be considered the real parents of children produced by reproductive technologies; and (3) is used to limit ART use where that use threatens to denaturalize the very sociopolitical landscape the race idea has created. In the second case, scientific knowledge regarding reproduction is thought to call for technological control over that reproduction. This leads to an overemphasis on personal responsibility and a depoliticization of racialized social inequalities." ;

Discussions of the role that they can play in stimulating religious contemplation or even as sacred icons charged with power have also appeared in English scholarship.

This paper discusses how the founder of the Japanese school of Shingon Buddhism, the Buddhist monk Kukai of the ninth century, uses this term in a metaphorical sense to convey the transformed nature of awareness that is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice. Emphasis is also placed on the importance of metaphorical thinking to the religious path of transformation itself." ;

    schema:about "In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today's healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means \"health care in cyberspace\" - for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally - in neighborhoods, \"minute clinics,\" and homes - using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network - for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven \"pillars\" of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease. In this paper we discuss how Cybercare is being implemented now, and envision its growth by 2030." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: Daily-event precipitation samples collected in Underhill, VT from 1995 to 2006 were analyzed for total mercury and results suggest that there were no statistically significant changes in annual mercury wet deposition over time, despite significant emissions reductions in the Northeast United States. Meteorological analysis indicates that mercury deposition has not decreased as transport of emissions from major source regions in the Midwest and East Coast have consistently contributed to the largest observed mercury wet deposition amounts over the period. In contrast, annual volume-weighted mean (VWM) mercury concentration declined slightly over the 12-years, and a significant decrease was observed from CY 2001 to 2006. An increase in the total annual precipitation amount corresponded with the decline in annual VWM mercury concentration. Analysis suggests that the increase in precipitation observed was strongly related to changes in the amount and type of precipitation that fell seasonally, and this departure was attributed to a response in meteorological conditions to climate variability and the El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Increased amounts of rainfall and mixed precipitation (mixture of rainfall and snowfall), particularly in the spring and fall seasons, enhanced annual precipitation amounts and resulted in declining VWM mercury concentrations during these periods. Thus, declines in concentration at the more remote Underhill site appear to be more directly linked to local scale meteorological and climatological variability than to a reduction in emissions of mercury to the atmosphere.

    schema:about "Abstract: Daily event precipitation samples were collected from 1995 to 2006 in Underhill, VT, USA and analyzed for mercury (Hg) and trace elements. Over the 12-year period, annual Hg deposition levels at Underhill did not decline significantly despite regulatory efforts to reduce Hg emissions in the United States. Mercury and trace element wet deposition data were examined using the multivariate receptor model EPA PMF 3.0 to identify the sources contributing to Hg deposition at the Underhill site. Results indicate that coal combustion, a mixture of incineration and non-ferrous metal smelting, and a phosphorus source contributed to the observed Hg wet deposition. The model consistently indicated that coal combustion contributed ~60% of the total Hg measured in wet deposition and the contribution from this source did not change significantly over time. Mercury and trace element deposition were further analyzed using a hybrid-receptor model, quantitative transport bias analysis (QTBA), to identify the likely source locations contributing to Hg deposition. Results from QTBA indicate that the majority of Hg deposition at Underhill is due to transport from the Midwestern United States, where the density of coal-fired utility boilers in the U.S. is largest.

    schema:about "Atmospheric emissions from the Chicago/Gary urban/industrial area significantly enhance ambient mercury (Hg) concentrations and lead to increased levels of atmospheric Hg deposition within the Lake Michigan Basin. We use airborne observations collected over Lake Michigan during the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) campaign to quantify the outflow of total Hg (THg) emissions from the Chicago/Gary urban/industrial area. We use concurrent airborne measurements of THg, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) to calculate measured enhancement ratios and to characterize Chicago/Gary emissions with respect to the 2011 U.S. EPA National Emissions Inventory. We determine the observed THg/CO enhancement ratio in outflow from Chicago/Gary to be 0.21 +/- 0.09 x 10(-6) mol mol(-1) (ppqv/ppbv), which is comparable to observations reported for other major U.S. urban/industrial areas. We also employ the FLEXPART Lagrangian transport and dispersion model to simulate air mass transport during plume encounters and to compare our observations to inventoried emission ratios. We find that our observed THg/CO enhancement ratios are 63-67% greater than the transport-corrected emission ratios for the Chicago/Gary area. Our results suggest that there are many small emission sources that are not fully accounted for within the inventory, and/or that the re-emission of legacy Hg is a significant source of THg to the atmosphere in this region.

    schema:about "Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 80(1) of Brain and Cognition (see record rid]2012-20606-019/rid]). In the original article, in the caption to Fig. 4, the first sentence labels the Happy and Angry tasks incorrectly. The sentence should read: 'Mean dRT for facial expressions in Experiment 3 on Happy (dark circles; solid regression line) and Angry (light circles; dashed regression line) tasks (first task completed only).'] Converging behavioral and neural evidence suggests that numerical representations are mentally organized in left-to-right orientation. Here we show that this format of spatial organization extends to emotional expression. In Experiment 1, right-side responses became increasingly faster as number (represented by Arabic numerals) or happiness (depicted in facial stimuli) increased, for judgments completely unrelated to magnitude. Additional experiments suggest that magnitude (i.e., more/less relations), not valence (i.e., positive/negative), underlies left-to-right orientation of emotional expression (Experiment 2), and that this orientation accommodates to the context-relevant emotion (e.g., happier faces are more rightward when judged on happiness, but more leftward when judged on angriness; Experiment 3). These findings show that people automatically extract magnitude from a variety of stimuli, representing such information in common left-to-right format, perhaps reflecting a mental magnitude line. We suggest that number is but one dimension in a hyper-general representational system uniting disparate dimensions of magnitude and likely subserved by common neural mechanisms in posterior parietal cortex.

    schema:about "Adding charcoal to soil (biochar soil amendment) can sequester carbon and improve soil performance, although the extent and exact mechanisms of soil improvement are not clear. Additionally, biochar properties can vary significantly with production conditions. Here we characterize the impact of pyrolysis temperature on two important soil hydrologic properties: field capacity and hydrophobicity. We show that pure biochar exhibits a wide range in both properties depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. We find that both properties can be controlled by choice of pyrolysis temperature; 400 degrees C-600 degrees C produced biochars with the most desirable hydrological properties (peak field capacity and minimum hydrophobicity). Further, we show that hydrophobicity is strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.87; p < 0.001) to the presence of alkyl functionalities in FTIR spectra, suggesting that this property derives from aliphatic domains on the surface of low-temperature biochars. Although we could relate hydrophobicity to biochar chemistry, our chemical characterization techniques were insufficient to describe variation in field capacity of soil-biochar mixtures. Field capacity may be related to large biochar pores, suggesting the need for quantitative techniques to characterize large (greater than 0.1 mu m) pores within biochar particles.

    schema:about "Partitioning of chromosomes into euchromatic and heterochromatic domains requires mechanisms that specify boundaries. The S. pombe JmjC family protein Epe1 prevents the ectopic spread of heterochromatin and is itself concentrated at boundaries. Paradoxically, Epe1 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 silencing factors that are distributed throughout heterochromatin. We demonstrate here that the selective enrichment of Epe1 at boundaries requires its regulation by the conserved Cul4-Ddb1(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase, which directly recognizes Epe1 and promotes its polyubiquitylation and degradation. Strikingly, in cells lacking the ligase, Epe1 persists in the body of heterochromatin thereby inducing a defect in gene silencing. Epe1 is the sole target of the Cul4-Ddb1(Cdt2) complex whose destruction is necessary for the preservation of heterochromatin. This mechanism acts parallel with phosphorylation of HP1/Swi6 by CK2 to restrict Epe1. We conclude that the ubiquitin-dependent sculpting of the chromosomal distribution of an antisilencing factor is critical for heterochromatin boundaries to form correctly." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: There is a gender imbalance in undergraduate economics departments with most departments educating a strong majority of young men. This imbalance has led many economists to ponder the question of why relatively few women choose to take courses and major in economics. Our hypothesis is that the gender imbalance in undergraduate economics, particularly at institutions with traditional liberal arts curriculums, is partly explained by women''s greater sensitivity to grades, particularly lower grades. Students choose their majors based on both their interests and their abilities. The literature indicates that the grade a student receives in an introductory class relative to grades received in other departments is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not the student chooses to enroll in more courses in the discipline. However, our hypothesis is that men who take economics courses are less responsive to this signal than are women. As a result, men who do poorly in economics are more likely to continue in the major. Women who do poorly, in contrast, are more likely to abandon economics and pursue a different major. Our results, generated from 16 years of data from a liberal arts college where economics is one of the most popular majors, support this hypothesis. The overall economics GPA for female majors is significantly higher than that for males and male students dominate the bottom of the grade distribution. Finally, results from the estimation of a series of selection models of the decision to take more economics courses indicate that, holding other characteristics constant, women are more responsive to the relative grade received than are men.

A liquid gallium electrode was used to drive the electroreduction of Sb 2 O 3 dissolved in 0.6 M NaOH. The quality and purity of the resultant films produced depended strongly on the chosen conditions, including temperature, time, and concentration of dissolved Sb 2 O 3 . Under select conditions, the direct production of polycrystalline films of GaSb was possible. Raman spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were separately used to analyze the identity and crystallinity of the electrodeposited films. The cumulative data showed that this electrodeposition process followed the features common both to conventional electrodeposition and melt crystal growth. Accordingly, this electrodeposition process could not be categorized as electrodeposition followed by annealing. Rather, the data implicate this method is akin to a hybrid electrodeposition solution-based crystal growth, where crystalline GaSb films could be grown up to thicknesses of 1 m in 60 min.

Cambrian deposits of this \"upper Lesser Himalayan\" succession, which include deposits of the \"outer\" Lesser Himalaya tectonic unit, are enriched in radiogenic Os-187. They make up part of a proximal marine fades belt that extends onto the craton and along strike from India to Pakistan. By contrast, age-equivalent facies in the Tethyan Himalaya are more distal in nature. Neoproterozoic to Cambrian strata of the upper Lesser Himalayan succession are now missing in much of the Lesser Himalaya, with their erosion exposing older Precambrian Lesser Himalayan strata. We suggest that exhumation and weathering of the upper Lesser Himalaya and related strata caused dramatic changes in the Os-187/Os-188 and Sr-87/Sr-86 Neogene record of seawater starting at similar to 16 Ma. First-order estimates for the volume of upper Himalayan strata, as well as the volume of all LH rock eroded since this time, and geochemical box modeling, support this idea. Exhumation at 16 Ma is a fundamental event in the evolution of the Himalayan orogeny and the geochemical evolution of the oceans, and will be a critical part of the construction of future models of Himalayan thrust belt evolution.

    schema:about "Intraplate strain generally focuses in discrete zones, but despite the profound impact of this partitioning on global tectonics, geodynamics, and seismic hazard, the processes by which deformation becomes localized are not well understood. Such heterogeneous intraplate strain is exemplified in central Asia, where the Indo-Eurasian collision has caused widespread deformation while the Tarim block has experienced minimal Cenozoic shortening. The apparent stability of Tarim may arise either because strain is dominantly accommodated by pre-existing faults in the continental suture zones that bound it -- essentially discretizing Eurasia into microplates -- or because the lithospheric-scale strength (i.e., viscosity) of the Tarim block is greater than its surroundings. Here, we jointly analyze seismic velocity, gravity, topography, and temperature to develop a 3-D density model of the crust and upper mantle in this region. The Tarim crust is characterized by high density, v s , v p , and v p / v s , consistent with a dominantly mafic composition and with the presence of an oceanic plateau beneath Tarim. Low-density but high-velocity mantle lithosphere beneath southern (southwestern) Tarim underlies a suite of Permian plume-related mafic intrusions and A-type granites sourced in previously depleted mantle lithosphere; we posit that this region was further depleted, dehydrated, and strengthened by Permian plume magmatism. The actively deforming western and southern margins of Tarim -- the Tien Shan, Kunlun Shan, and Altyn Tagh fault -- are underlain by buoyant upper mantle with low velocity; we hypothesize that this material has been hydrated by mantle-derived fluids that have preferentially migrated along Paleozoic continental sutures. Such hydrous material should be weak, and herein strain focuses there because of lithospheric-scale variations in rheology rather than the pre-existence of faults in the brittle crust. Thus this world-class example of strain partitioning arises not simply from the pre-existence of brittle faults but from the thermo-chemical and therefore rheological variations inherited from prior tectonism.

    schema:about "Geospatially distributed isotopes (isoscapes) from biogeochemically fractionated processes have been applied in many forensic investigations, such as authentication of food and sourcing of drugs. Provenancing of human remains using isotopes has been hindered by a lack of appropriate isoscapes, by changes in these isoscapes over time, and by various homogenization processes. In this study we create spatiotemporal isoscapes for anthropogenic lead (Pb) for the contiguous United States and Europe using literature data from dated sediments, soils and biological tissues. We compare Pb-206/Pb-207 isoscapes with isoscapes of delta C-13, delta O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86 to determine their relative efficacy for the forensic identification of human remains. We do this comparison using third molar enamel data from 22 United States Air Force Academy cadets with known life trajectories born between 1983 and 1985. We use these spatiotemporal isoscapes with osteologic analyses, hospital records and isotopic analyses of tooth enamel carbonate from permanent teeth to help identify 32 individuals from unmarked graves found in a forgotten 19th century mental asylum cemetery.

    schema:about "RFX transcription factors are master regulators of ciliogenesis in diverse animal species. The sole Caenorhabditis elegans RFX homolog, DAF-19, plays at least two roles in the formation of functional cilia. The DAF-19(c) isoform is required for ciliogenesis and the DAF-19(m) isoform is required for the functional specialization of a subset of male-specific ciliated neurons called PKD neurons. Here we report the identification of a novel mutation, daf19(sm129), which disrupts the functional specification of PKD neurons and thus suggests that daf-19m activity is compromised. However, ciliogenesis is not disrupted in daf-19(sm129) mutants suggesting that daf-19c activity is retained. The sm129 mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site adjacent to an exon common to the daf-19c and daf-19m isoforms resulting in aberrant splicing in a proportion of transcripts. While aberrant splicing of daf-19c to upstream cryptic sites results in in-frame and functional products, a large proportion of daf-19m mRNAs include the entire upstream intron, which introduces a frameshift and stop codons. At least 15% of disease-causing mutations affect splicing of the gene bearing the mutation, thus it is important to understand the consequences of splice site mutations on gene function. However, predicting the effects of a splice site mutation remains difficult and experimental determination is still required. Using daf-19(sm129) as a model, our results suggest that this problem is exacerbated when a splice acceptor mutation is used by multiple isoforms of the same gene because the effects on each isoform can be dramatically different.

    schema:about "At different times during recent human evolution, northern Africa has served as a conduit for migrations from the Arabian Peninsula. Although previous researchers have investigated the possibility of the Strait of Gibraltar as a pathway of migration from North Africa to Iberia, we now revisit this issue and theorize that although the Strait of Gibraltar, at the west end of this corridor, has acted as a barrier for human dispersal into Southwest Europe, it has not provided an absolute seal to gene flow. To test this hypothesis, here we use the spatial frequency distributions, STR diversity and expansion time estimates of Y chromosome haplogrotipsil J1-P58 and E-M81 to investigate the genetic imprints left by the Arabian and Berber expansions into the Iberian Peninsula, respectively. The data generated indicate that Arabian and Berber genetic markers are detected in Iberia. We present evidence that suggest that Iberia has received gene flow from Northwest Africa during and prior to the Islamic colonization of 711 A.D. It is interesting that the highest frequencies of Arabia and Berber markers are not found in southern Spain, where Islam remained the longest and was culturally most influential, but in Northwest Iberia, specifically Galicia. We propose that Moriscos' relocations to the north during the Reconquista, the migration of cryptic Muslims seeking refuge in a more lenient society and/or more geographic extensive pre-Islamic incursions may explain the higher frequencies and older time estimates of mutations in the north of the Peninsula. These scenarios are congruent with the higher diversities of some diagnostic makers observed in Northwest Iberia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "At an average altitude of 4000 m above sea level, the Tibetan plateau is one of the highest plains on the planet. It is surrounded on three sides by massive mountain ranges: the Kunlun, the Karakoram and the Himalayas. These natural barriers have kept Tibet relatively isolated. In the present study, 15 autosomal STR loci were genotyped in 338 unrelated individuals from three traditional provinces of historical Tibet: Amdo (86), Kham (101) and U-Tsang (151). All the studied loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for the D19S433 locus in the Kham province. FGA, D21S11 and D2S1338 show the highest observed heterozygosity values in Amdo (0.8954), Kham (0.9208) and U-Tsang (0.8940), respectively, whereas TPOX is the least variable marker displaying the lowest value for the same parameter. U-Tsang exhibits the highest total numbers of alleles (139) followed by Kham (130) and Amdo (128) groups. The allele frequency data from this study were compared to relevant global reference populations. Our results indicate that although these three Tibetan populations group together in both the Correspondence Analysis (CA) plot and the Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree, they exhibit some degree of genetic differentiation among themselves congruent with their unique dialects, cultures and traditions. The 15 autosomal STR loci studied were found to be informative and discriminating, thereby providing a useful set of markers for population genetic studies.

    schema:about "Notwithstanding the general interest and the geopolitical importance of the island countries in the Greater Antilles, little is known about the specific ancestral Native American and African populations that settled them. In an effort to alleviate this lacuna of information on the genetic constituents of the Greater Antilles, we comprehensively compared the mtDNA compositions of Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. To accomplish this, the mtDNA HVRI and HVRII regions, as well as coding diagnostic sites, were assessed in the Haitian general population and compared to data from reference populations. The Taino maternal DNA is prominent in the ex-Spanish colonies (61.3%-22.0%) while it is basically non-existent in the ex-French and ex English colonies of Haiti (0.0%) and Jamaica (0.5%), respectively. The most abundant Native American mtDNA haplogroups in the Greater Antilles are A2, B2 and C1. The African mtDNA component is almost fixed in Haiti (98.2%) and Jamaica (98.5%), and the frequencies of specific African haplogroups vary considerably among the five island nations. The strong persistence of Taino mtDNA in the ex-Spanish colonies (and especially in Puerto Rico), and its absence in the French and English excolonies is likely the result of different social norms regarding mixed marriages with Taino women during the early years after the first contact with Europeans. In addition, this article reports on the results of an integrative approach based on mtDNA analysis and demographic data that tests the hypothesis of a southward shift in raiding zones along the African west coast during the period encompassing the Transatlantic Slave Trade." ;

    schema:about "International agricultural carbon market projects face significant challenges in delivering greenhouse gas mitigation objectives whilst also seeking to provide additional benefits for poverty alleviation. The carbon credit producer (the smallholder farmer) and carbon credit buyer in the carbon market transaction typically operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Buyers operate at a global scale, responding to opportunities for financial speculation and both private and public climate action plans. Farmers operate within households, farms, and immediate agricultural landscapes, pursuing livelihood and food security needs. These different scales often result in mismatches of timing, payment, and knowledge in market transactions and can be partially rectified by project developers who serve to broker the relationship between the farmers and the buyers. We examined eight East African agricultural carbon market projects to determine how project developers function as bridging organizations and minimize the mismatches between these actors. Results show that projects better bridged the timing and payment gap between buyers and producers when project developers provided non-monetary benefits or direct monetary assistance to farmers. However, knowledge gaps remained a significant barrier for farmers wishing to participate in the market. We discuss how project developers brokered relationships in ways that reflected their interests and highlight the limitations, trade-offs, and challenges that must be overcome if win-win outcomes of poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation are to be realized.

    schema:about "The paper uses individual level data from each student that has enrolled in each class in the department in the last five years. Unlike several past studies that lack data on teaching quality measures Ordered Probit models reveal that the significant determinants of effective teaching, based on student evaluations of teaching (SET) are: organization, clarity of exposition, availability and enthusiasm of the instructor. The gender and race of the instructor is significant with female and non-white instructors being downgraded by students. The usual findings of expected grades inflating teaching evaluations are contested by the empirical evidence from this paper. Highly selective liberal arts colleges claim to provide a better education based on smaller class sizes and excellent teachers that are also active scholars. The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of effective teaching in Economics and Business, according to student evaluations of teaching (SET) at one such college. The paper will begin with a literature review of the scholarship on teaching evaluations. The next section will describe the dataset and the models used to examine teaching effectiveness. The paper will conclude with a discussion of the econometric results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

Simulations demonstrate that explanations of the results using large IDs based on the hypothesis of a \"zone of speculative inactivity\" are inconsistent with empirical evidence. Furthermore, it is shown that, if agents forecast IDs based on long-run values, coefficient estimates will be unstable if rates of decay in IDs vary significantly and, for ex post UIP to hold, IDs must decay in absolute value.

    schema:about "Background: Internationally, depression is a common psychological disorder whose treatment depends upon its identification by treating professionals as well as patient utilization of mental health care systems: the latter often being hampered by cultural differences between patients and health professionals. Method: The current study used vignettes of depressed patients which varied the culture and/or social circumstances of the patient to assess whether these variables influenced the conceptualization of depression and its treatment. Participants (N=722) included mental health professionals, lay people, immigrants, and refugees in Norway. Results: We found that immigrants and refugees, particularly those of non-western origin, endorsed different types of depression treatments from native Norwegians and mental health professionals, and judged who deserved treatment and who was overreacting based on the patient's culture and social circumstances, while native Norwegians did not. Limitations: While widely used cross-culturally, vignette methodology is limited in its generalizability to real clinical situations. Acculturation was not evaluated, which may have influenced the results. Conclusions: Findings support the integration of cultural competency ideals not only into treatment, but also into public health promotions of mental health services for lay people.

    schema:about "It is commonplace to assert causal relationships between episodes of extreme climate with dramatic cultural shifts. We explore the problem of statistically assessing the correspondence between episodes of extreme climate (such as droughts) and cultural events (such as depopulation) they are purported to explain. In order to do this: 1) We describe a method that permits the objective identification of climate extremes in a way that is independent of their supposed causal outcomes; 2) We discuss how we identify and date cultural transitions of interest; 3) We explore a variety of decision rules for determining whether or not there is a match between a given extreme climate interval and the interval during which a transition began: and 4) We propose an intuitive Monte Carlo approach to statistically assess the observed correspondence between the climate extremes and the cultural transitions. Our application does not indicate statistical support for a linkage between intervals of extreme climate and major transitions in any of the seven cultural traditions in the Southwest US that we examined.

We study the short run effects of the arrival of democracy on different measures of women's empowerment by exploiting exogenous variation in the government through abolition of the monarchy. This paper employs a propensity score matching estimator to evaluate the linkage between change in political regime and opinions related to women's empowerment from 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). Results show that women's say in decision making increased significantly, and opinions on violence against women strengthened. We further scrutinize the treatment effect estimates with Rosenbaum bounds and observe if they are sensitive to possible hidden selection bias. We also test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect across gender and find that males report higher probability of mutual household decision-making among couples than females.

    schema:about "To identify which spouses respond to asymmetric information, I play two dictator games with each member of the couple. One decision is kept secret from the respondent's spouse, while another choice is public. Most people give the same amount in public and secret, while a minority behave opportunistically and give more to their spouse in public and less in secret. The types identified in the lab also behave differently at home. For those who behave opportunistically in the lab, greater knowledge about finances at home is associated with worse opportunism in the lab, suggesting that for these couples complete information at home is not due to trust but rather is an endogenous response to non-cooperative behavior. The paper highlights that allowing for heterogeneous types changes the conclusions we draw about appropriate models of the household and suggests that laboratory games can be used to identify household types useful in the interpretation of field data." ;

    schema:about "In this research the outcome of an affective priming experiment is shown to critically depend on the frequency of occurrence of the target words used. Low frequency target words (5.7 occurrences per million words) resulted in an affective congruency effect, i.e., faster responses following affectively congruent than incongruent primes. High frequency target words (32.6 occurrences per million) resulted in a reverse priming effect, i.e., faster responses following incongruent than congruent primes. The size of the congruency effect was larger than the size of the reverse priming effect, thus masking its emergence when word frequency was not taken into account. We propose that target word frequency has its influence via an accessibility-related mechanism having to do with differences in observed changes in affect between prime and target.

    schema:about "Purpose Lag screw fixation is reported to provide the most biomechanically stable construct for fixation of oblique or spiral metacarpal fractures. Lac, screws are inserted after overdrilling the proximal cortex, resulting in compression at the fracture site. Minor drilling errors an result in poor screw purchase, instability, and ultimately impaired fracture healing. In an in vitro study, we compared construct stability provided by nonlagged and lagged screw fixation. Methods A cadaveric human metacarpal model was used. After removing the soft tissue, long oblique osteotomies were made in 24 metacarpals, which were then randomized to lagged or nonlagged fixation. Nonlagged fixation was performed through a newly introduced reduction system. Fixed specimens were subjected to biomechanical analysis by way of cantilevered bending to failure, and calculations were made for axial stress and normalized stiffness. Results All specimens failed in a typical manner through the proximal screw site. Nonlagged compared with lagged screw fixation resulted in a higher axial stress and normalized stiffness, althouch the differences did not reach statistical significance. Condusions Nonlagged screw fixation with use of a precompression device provided cornparable fracture site stiffness and biomechanical stability Without use of lag screws while removing the requirement for overdrilling, thus simplifying the technique.

    schema:about "Summary. The amendment of soil with biochar can sequester carbon and alter hydrologic properties by changing physical and chemical characteristics of soil. To understand the effect of biochar amendment on soil hydrology, we measured the hydraulic conductivity ( K ) of biocharâ€“sand mixtures as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachate. Specifically, we assessed the effects of biochar concentration and particle size on K and amount of DOC in the soil leachate. To better understand how physical properties influenced K , we also measured the skeletal density of biochars and sand, and the bulk density, the water saturation, and the porosity of biocharâ€“sand mixtures. Our model soil was sand (0.251â€“0.853 mm) with biochar rates from 2 to 10 wt% (g biochar/g total soil Ã— 100%). As biochar (&lt;0.853 mm) concentration increased from 0 to 10 wt%, K decreased by 72 Â± 3%. When biochar particle size was equal to, greater than, and less than particle size of sand, we found that biochar in different particle sizes have different effects on K . For a 2 wt% biochar rate, K decreased by 72 Â± 2% when biochar particles were finer than sand particles, and decreased by 15 Â± 2% when biochar particles were coarser than sand particles. When biochar and sand particle size were comparable, we observed no significant effect on K . We propose that the decrease of K through the addition of fine biochar was because finer biochar particles filled spaces between sand particles, which increased tortuosity and reduced pore throat size of the mixture. The decrease of K associated with coarser biochar was caused by the bimodal particle size distribution, resulting in more compact packing and increased tortuosity. The loss of biochar C as DOC was related to both biochar rate and particle size. The cumulative DOC loss was 1350% higher from 10 wt% biochar compared to pure sand. This large increase reflected the very small DOC yield from pure sand. In addition, DOC in the leachate decreased as biochar particle size increased. For all treatments, the fraction of carbon lost as DOC ranged from 0.06 to 0.18 wt% of biochar. These experiments suggest that mixing sandy soils with biochar is likely to reduce infiltration rates, holding water near the surface longer with little loss of biochar-derived carbon to groundwater and streams.

An international real business cycle model is used to demonstrate that real exchange rate volatility increases if (i) it is costly to move labor between sectors and (ii) the consumption of tradable goods requires distribution services. Model dynamics are generated by shocks to productivity and preferences based on sectoral output, employment and consumption data from G-7 countries. The introduction of intersectoral adjustment and distribution costs substantially increases the real exchange rate volatility generated by the model. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "This paper uses a unique new monthly US-UK real exchange rate series for the January 1794-December 2009 period to reexamine the academic debate over purchasing power parity (PPP). The consensus view described by Rogoff (1996) is that PPP holds in the long-run, but short-run deviations are very persistent, with half-lives ranging from 3 to 5 years. Most of the literature using long time series relies on the annual data developed by Lee (1976) and Lothian and Taylor (1996), which were both constructed from underlying higher-frequency data sources. Estimates of purchasing power parity persistence using these series may therefore be subject to temporal aggregation bias. We find evidence of aggregation bias which indicates the half-life of PPP deviations has been overestimated in much of the previous literature. We also find that estimates of the half-lives are further reduced once we account for the Harrod (1933)-Balassa (1964)Samuelson (1964) effect. The result of aggregation bias appears to be robust even when considering the case that real exchange rates exhibit nonlinear dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "This paper employs structural vector autoregression methods to examine the contribution of real and nominal shocks to real exchange rate movements using two hundred and seventeen years of data from Britain and the United States. Shocks are identified with long-run restrictions. The long time series makes possible an investigation of how the role of nominal shocks has evolved over time due to changes in the shock processes or to structural changes in the economy which might alter how a shock is transmitted to the real exchange rate. The sample is split at 1913, which is the end of the classical gold standard period, the last of the monetary regimes of the 19th century. The earlier subsample (1795-1913) shows a much stronger role for nominal shocks in explaining real exchange rate movements than the later subsample (1914-2010). Counterfactual analysis shows that the difference between the two periods is mainly due to the size of the nominal shocks rather than structural changes in the economy. These findings are consistent with the view that the financial instability and frequent deflation of the 19th century had real economic effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "A critical issue in quantitative neuromorphology is the accuracy and subsequent reliability of the tracing techniques employed to characterize neuronal components. Historically, the camera lucida was the only option for such investigations. In 1987, MBF Bioscience, Inc. (Williston, VT) developed the integrative Neurolucida computer-microscope system, replacing the camera lucida drawing tube with a Lucivid cathode ray tube, thereby allowing computer overlays directly on the view through microscope oculars. Subsequent advances in digital cameras have allowed the Lucivid system to be replaced so that microscope images can be traced by viewing the digital image on a computer monitor. Indeed, the camera systems now outsell Lucivid systems 9 to 1 (J. Glaser, personal communication, 08/2008). Nevertheless, researchers seldom note which of these configurations are being used (which may confound the accuracy of data sharing), and there have been no published comparisons of the Lucivid and camera configurations. The present study thus assesses the relative accuracy of these two hardware configurations by examining reconstructions of human pyramidal neurons. We report significant differences with respect to dendritic spines, with the camera estimates of spine counts being greater than those obtained with the Lucivid system. Potential underlying reasons (e.g., magnification, illumination, and resolution, as well as observer ergonomic differences between the two systems) for these quantitative findings are explored here, along with qualitative observations on the relative strengths of each configuration.

We find that, while self-esteem has a positive and significant impact on wages indirectly via education, it does not significantly affect wages directly once we control for locus of control. We find that the indirect effect of self-esteem comprises upwards of 80% of the total effect of self-esteem on wages after 1980. Additionally, we find that wages and education both affect self-esteem. We discuss gender differences in the relationships between wages, education, and self-esteem and conclude that females experience a higher rate of return on education than males, and self-esteem is a stronger determinant of educational attainment for males than females.

    schema:about "Classic economic theory assumes that time preference is a stable parameter. However, a large literature in psychology theory suggests that initial exertions of self-control affect one's ability to deploy self-control subsequently. As savings decisions require individuals to make trade-offs between immediate gratification and future rewards, the self-control literature suggests that expression of time preference is susceptible to environmental influences, a contradiction of the neoclassical stability assumption. Empirical evidence is mixed. This paper proposes that self-control use has heterogeneous effects on the expression of economic time preference. Using a Stroop task to experimentally induce self-control fatigue in university students in Northern Ethiopia, we find that treated subjects with below median finances behave more impatiently in an incentivized time preference task than do untreated subjects. By contrast, treated relatively wealthy students do not behave differently than their untreated counterparts. Our results suggest that the psychological environment does affect the expression of time preference, but self-control use does not uniformly deplete patience for all subjects. Our results are most consistent with the process model of self-control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "The spread of HIV and AIDS and risky sexual behavior continues to be a problem in Sub-Saharan African countries despite government measures to educate people on the risk and severity of the disease and measures to promote safe sex practices such as making condoms readily available at reduced or no cost. We examine whether people decide to engage in risky sexual behavior due to low income and low life expectancy. Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by conditions that significantly reduce life expectancy such as unsanitary conditions prevalent in poverty stricken areas, inaccessibility to health care, and dangerous working conditions such as those in very poor mining regions. Moreover, since income per capita in these countries is very low, the opportunity cost associated with dying from AIDS and foregoing future consumption is very low. We examine how a government provided life insurance benefit may be an effective means of deterring risky sexual behavior. To evaluate this policy prescription we develop a life-cycle model with personal and family consumption and endogenous probability of survival. In the model, agents can receive life insurance benefits if their death is not the result of AIDS. We demonstrate that excessive risky behavior does result from low life expectancy and low levels of income and illustrate the conditions for which the life insurance benefit can replicate the effects of higher income and life expectancy, deterring risky sexual behavior and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS.

    schema:about "New and published stratigraphic data are integrated herein to resolve the age and depositional setting of Middle Devonian strata in the Gobi-Altai Terrane of south-central Mongolia (Bayanhongar Province). The Tsagaankhaalga Formation (Emsian?-Eifelian) is composed primarily of tabular sandy carbonates; it is sharply overlain by dark, fine-grained volcanoclastic marine sedimentary rock of the Govialtai Formation (Givetian), which is comparatively unfossiliferous, except for sporadic, fossiliferous carbonate interbeds. The latter unit contains abundant tentaculites as well as a newly recovered collection of conodonts assigned to the lower Givetian varcus Zone (timorensis, rhenana, or ansatus). A positive shift in bulk magnetic susceptibility coincides with the Tsagaankhaalga/Govialtai contact, and elevated values within the Govialtai correspond to tuffaceous and rhyolitic strata. The transition from carbonate facies of the Tsagaankhaalga Formation to the volcanoclastic shales of the Govialtai Formation is interpreted as the result of local tectonic activity. This may be qualitatively described as a transition from a shallow marine carbonate shoal with an epibenthic fauna (Tsagaankhaalga), to a deeper, clastic dominated environment with a nektic fauna (Govialtai). The pulse of tectonism must predate the lower Givetian, and it echoes the \"Tsakhir Event\", which is recorded by the transition from Ordovician-Silurian carbonates to Lochkovian conglomerate. These findings provide useful biostratigraphic control and insight into the complex tectonic evolution of the Gobi-Altai Terrane and adjacent blocks on the Eurasian Craton. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

    schema:about "A total of 223 samples from the general population of Ladakh in Northwestern India were amplified at 17 Y-STR loci using the AmpF l STRÂ® Yfilerâ„¢ system. The DNA profiles generated were employed to generate allelic frequencies, gene diversity, haplotype diversity and discrimination capacity values as well as number of different haplotypes, fraction of unique haplotypes and Rst pair wise genetic distances. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Correspondence Analysis (CA) were performed with the Rst values and allelic frequencies, respectively. The 17-loci discrimination capacity of Ladakh was found to be 0.8093. Eleven out of the 16 loci have diversity values greater than 0.6, and 13 loci possess values greater than 0.5. Ladakh exhibits no significant genetic difference to seven of the 15 reference forensic databases after Bonferroni correction, three of which are located in South Central Asian and four are from the Himalayan region. Rst genetic distance values before and after Bonferroni corrections illustrate the capacity of the Yfiler system to discriminate among Himalayan populations. The intermediate position of the Ladakh population in the MDS and CA plots likely reflects genetic flow and admixture with neighboring populations. In addition, the longitudinal partition of populations in the MDS and CA plots likely reflect human dispersals such as the silk road migrations.

    schema:about "In Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica, the Fosdick Mountains migmatite-cored gneiss dome was exhumed from mid- to lower middle crustal depths during the incipient stage of the West Antarctic Rift system in the mid-Cretaceous. Prior to and during exhumation, major crustal melting and deformation induded transfer and emplacement of voluminous granitic material and numerous intrusions of mantle-derived diorite in dikes. A succession of melt- and magma-related structures formed at temperatures in excess of 665 +/- 50 degrees C based on Ti-in-zircon thermometry. These record a transition from wrench to oblique extensional deformation that culminated in the development of the oblique South Fosdick Detachment zone. Solid-state fabrics within the detachment zone and overprinting brittle structures record translation of the detachment zone and dome to shallow levels. To determine the duration of exhumation and cooling, we sampled granite and gneisses at high spatial resolution for U-Pb zircon geochronology and Ar-40/Ar-39 hornblende and biotite thermochronology. U-Pb zircon crystallization ages for the youngest granites are 102 Ma. Three hornblende ages are 103 to 100 Ma and 12 biotite ages are 101 to 99 Ma. All overlap within uncertainty. The coincidence of zircon crystallization ages with Ar-40/Ar-39 cooling ages indicates cooling rates >100 degrees C/m.y. that, when considered together with overprinting structures, indicates rapid exhumation of granite and migmatite from deep to shallow crustal levels within a transcurrent setting. Orientations of structures and age-constrained crosscutting relationships indicate counterclockwise rotation of stretching axes from oblique extension into nearly orthogonal extension with respect to the Marie Byrd Land margin. The rotation may be a result of localized extension arising from unroofing and arching of the Fosdick dome, extensional opening within a pull-apart zone, or changes in plate boundary configuration. The rapid tectonic and temperature evolution of the Fosdick Mountains dome lends support to recently developed numerical models of crustal flow and cooling in orogenic crust undergoing extension/transtension, and accords with numerous studies of migmatite-cored gneiss domes in transcurrent settings.

    schema:about "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous, bioaccumulative flame retardants. Much remains to be learned about their developmental toxicological properties, particularly with regards to chronic exposure. In two experiments, male Long-Evans rats ingested the commercial pentaBDE mixture DE-71 from birth onward, first through the milk of lactating dams (who ingested 5 or 7.5 mg DE-71/day in a custom-mixed chow), then directly via chow consumption (at a dose of 3 or 4.5 mg/day). Control rats consumed the same brand of chow without DE-71. As adults, the rats were assessed for learning and attention using a series of five-choice serial reaction time tasks. A challenge with the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (0, 0.01, 0.03, or 0.05 mg/kg injected s.c.) was conducted on the final attention task. Serum total thyroxine (T4) levels were obtained at the end of testing. Total T4 was significantly lower in both DE-71 groups than in controls. Visual discrimination learning was unaffected by DE-71, but rats ingesting 4.5 mg/day DE-71 demonstrated significant impairments in sustained attention and inhibitory control, as evidenced by increased premature responding and decreased accuracy of responding in Attention Task 1. However, the DE-71-exposed rats did not respond differentially to the effects of scopolamine on attention compared to controls. These effects of chronic developmental DE-71 exposure differ from effects seen with brief postnatal exposure, suggesting that more research needs to be done on the more environmentally relevant chronic exposure model.

    schema:about "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), flame retardant chemicals added to polymer products, have become ubiquitous in the environment, and they are bioaccumulating in humans and wildlife. Therefore, understanding their biological effects is important for public health. We have previously observed learning deficits in rats exposed to DE-71, a commercial PBDE mixture consisting primarily of pentabrominated diphenyl ethers, at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day from postnatal day (PND) 6 to 12. The purpose of the current study was to determine if this effect could be seen with lower doses of DE-71. Long-Evans rats were administered daily oral doses of corn oil alone or DE-71, 5 or 15 mg/kg/day, dissolved in corn oil, from PND 6 to 12. As young adults, the rats were administered a series of five-choice visual learning and attention tasks. No effects of DE-71 were found on learning, attention, or inhibitory control. Given that developmental DE-71 exposure at similar doses and for shorter time periods has been shown in other laboratories to affect locomotion and hyperactivity, the current results suggest that cognitive functions may not be as sensitive as neuromotor functions to the effects of acute DE-71 exposure.

    schema:about "In designing screens to assess potential neurotoxicants, the paramount goal is that the selected assessment tools detect dysfunction if it exists. This goal is particularly challenging in the case of cognitive assessments. Cognition is not a unitary phenomenon, and indeed there is growing evidence that different aspects of cognitive functioning are subserved by distinct neural systems. As a result, if a particular neurotoxicant selectively damages certain neural systems but not others, it can impair some cognitive, sensory, or affective functions, but leave many others intact. Accordingly, studies with human subjects use batteries of cognitive tests, cognizant of the fact that no one test is capable of detecting all forms of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, assessment of cognitive functioning in non-human animal developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) studies typically consists of a single, presumably representative, \"learning and memory\" task that is expected to detect all potential effects on cognitive functioning. Streamlining the cognitive assessment in these studies saves time and money, but these shortcuts can have serious consequences if the aspect of cognitive functioning that is impaired is not tapped by the single selected task. In particular, executive functioning - a constellation of cognitive functions which enables the organism to focus on multiple streams of information simultaneously, and revise plans as necessary - is poorly assessed in most animal DNT studies. The failure to adequately assess these functions - which include attention, working memory, inhibitory control, and planning - is particularly worrisome in light of evidence that the neural systems that subserve these functions may be uniquely vulnerable to early developmental insults. We illustrate the importance of tapping these areas of functioning in DNT studies by describing the pattern of effects produced by early developmental Pb exposure. Rats exposed to lead (Pb) early in development were tested on a series of automated attention tasks, as well as on a radial arm maze task. The lead-exposed rats were not impaired in this demanding radial arm maze task, despite conditions which tapped the limits of both working and long-term memory. In contrast, the automated tests designed to assess rodent executive functioning revealed selective and functionally important deficits in attention and regulation of emotion or negative affect (produced by committing an error or not receiving an expected reward). This example underscores the importance of including tasks to specifically tap executive functioning in DNT batteries. Such tasks are not only sensitive but can also shed light on the specific nature of the dysfunction, and they can implicate dysfunction of specific neural systems, information which can be used to design therapeutic interventions. Although the use of such tasks increases the time and effort needed to complete the battery, the benefits outweigh the cost, in light of the greater sensitivity of the battery and the more complete characterization of effects.

Decisions to include or not include these tests in a battery for a particular compound absolutely must be made in consultation with those who understand the intricacies of behavioral neuroscience in the model species. The author agrees with Herr's suggestion to regularize a negotiation process between regulatory authorities and sponsors to agree upon specific tests based on data from similar compounds or classes of compounds. Sobin emphasizes an important aspect of DNT testing that must not be neglected in the designing of testing batteries: a lifespan approach is vital for identifying in particular the delayed effects of early insults to the nervous system. In order to properly assess for changes across the lifespan, repeated tests of the same animals is ideal; and, as she mentions, tests of cognitive function that require extended training have poor temporal resolution. Indeed, 'no training' and 'minimal training' tests, such as those for various aspects of motor and sensory function, are by nature well-suited for multipletesting studies.

    schema:about "Five studies compare the effects of forming an independent judgment prior to receiving advice with the effects of receiving advice before forming one's own opinion. We call these the independent-then-revise sequence and the dependent sequence, respectively. We found that dependent participants adjusted away from advice, leading to fewer estimates close to the advice compared to independent-then-revise participants (Studies 1-5). This \"push-away\" effect was mediated by confidence in the advice (Study 2), with dependent participants more likely to evaluate advice unfavorably and to search for additional cues than independent-then-revise participants (Study 3). Study 4 tested accuracy under different advice sequences. Study 5 found that classic anchoring paradigms also show the push-away effect for median advice. Overall, the research shows that people adjust from representative (median) advice. The paper concludes by discussing when push-away effects occur in advice taking and anchoring studies and the value of independent distributions for observing these effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

    schema:about "Upper Devonian to Lower Mississippian strata in Utah and Montana record global events through this important interval in Earth history. Late Famennian strata of the Beirdneau, Leatham, and Pilot Shale formations in Utah, and Three Forks and Sappington formations in Montana, record widespread deposition of generally fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate strata. Integration of sedimentology, physical stratigraphy, chemostratigraphy, and published biostratigraphy allows for the recognition of important disconformities and regional stratigraphic patterns. These enable the reconstruction of uppermost Devonian to lowermost Mississippian depositional, tectonic, and eustatic history of the region. Carbon isotopic data allows for stratigraphic evaluation of the presence and absence of global bioevents of the Late Devonian, including the Annulata, Dasberg, and Hangenberg events, some of which are clearly recorded in hinterland deposits to the east in Colorado. While the Devonian-Mississippian boundary is also missing in our sections, a significant positive shift in delta C-13(carb) in Lower Mississippian strata in Utah and Montana represents one of the largest positive delta C-13(carb) isotope excursions of the Phanerozoic, linked to drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and glaciation in the Kinderhookian. Detrital zircon spectra from latest Devonian to Early Mississippian strata of Utah and Colorado include populations representing derivation from the Mazatzal and Yavapai provinces, Middle Proterozoic anorogenic granite bodies, and a small influx of Grenville and presumed Appalachian-Caledonian grains. Minor Paleoproterozoic and Late Archean peaks in Utah are likely multiple generation grains originally derived from the Peace River Arch of northwestern Canada and recycled in Ordovician rocks of Nevada. These patterns in detrital zircon geochronological data reflect, in part, changes in sediment dispersal patterns due to tectonic and eustastic variability-within the Antler foreland basin during the Devonian-Mississippian boundary interval. This variability also led to irregular spatial patterns of unconformity development, as well as complicated physical stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    schema:about "The Birmania inlier in western Rajasthan, India, contains important phosphate deposits, the depositional age of which is poorly constrained. Here we provide the first direct age constraints for the phosphate-bearing Birmania Formation using a combination of paleontological and detrital zircon U-Pb data. The occurrence of the multicellular algal fossil Wengania exquisita in phosphatic chert of the Birmania Formation suggest that it was deposited during the Ediacaran. Detrital zircon age distributions contain prominent populations of 1.7-1.9 Ga grains, with subordinate younger grains that range from 650 to 980 Ma. The distribution broadly resembles those from Neoproterozoic strata from both cratonic and Himalayan India but, like zircon age distributions from the Marwar Group, lacks 1.0-1.2 Ga grains, which may suggest that both areas shared similar local sources. The lack of zircon grains younger than 650 Ma is consistent with an Ediacaran depositional age because almost all Cambrian or younger strata from India have yielded Cambrian or latest Neoproterozoic age grains. These findings raise the possibility of a previously unrecognized late Neoproterozoic episode of phosphogenesis on the India craton. The presence of Wengania exquisita further supports strong palaeogeographic affinity between the India and South China during the Neoproterozoic and Cambrian. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Results: Supporting the hypotheses, student-athletes who were primed with their athletic identity attempted significantly fewer problems and received lower mean math scores than those who were not primed. Contrary to hypotheses, gender did not impact effort or performance, and there was no evidence of buffering effects of priming non-athlete identities. Conclusions: The results of this experiment provide evidence for stereotype threat effects across genders and into Division III athletes, which potentially impact student-athlete academic performance.

    schema:about "High-resolution modern climate data for the Southern and Central Rocky Mountains provide a starting point for analysis of climate changes necessary to produce regional Late Pleistocene glaciation. A GIS-based model was used to assess the sensitivity of glaciation in different ranges to climatic change and the combinations of temperature and precipitation change necessary to sustain the last glacial maximum (LGM) extent of glaciation in each range. Extensive glaciation initiates first in the Wind River Range of Wyoming under every climate change scenario tested. In absence of precipitation change a summer temperature depression of 6-8 degrees C would be necessary to maintain LGM ice extents in Colorado and Wyoming. If precipitation was halved, necessary summer temperature depression would be 8-10 degrees C; if precipitation was doubled, a depression of 3.5-5.5 degrees C would suffice. Given model uncertainties, these values may underestimate necessary temperature depression by as much as 2 C. Under all scenarios tested, LGM glaciation in Utah, particularly the Wasatch Range, requires either more temperature depression for given precipitation change, or more precipitation for a given temperature depression than is required in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies. A summer temperature depression of 7 degrees C, which would suffice to sustain LGM ice extent with little change from modern precipitation in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies, would need to be coupled with a near doubling of precipitation to maintain LGM ice extent in the Wasatch Range. This difference appears to reflect LGM precipitation enhancement in the Wasatch Range, and to a lesser degree the Uinta Mountains, resulting from the presence of Lake Bonneville immediately upwind of these ranges.

    schema:about "Cosmogenic Be-10 surface-exposure dating and numerical glacier modeling are used to reconstruct glacial chronology and climate in the Colorado Sangre de Cristo Mountains during the local last glacial maximum (LLGM) and the subsequent deglaciation. Twenty-two surface-exposure ages on moraine boulders and polished-bedrock outcrops in the Willow Creek valley and ten in two adjacent valleys indicate that glaciers were at or near their maxima from similar to 21 ka until 17-16 ka, and then retreated rapidly, nearly deglaciating the Willow Creek valley entirely by similar to 14 ka. Coupled energy/mass-balance and flow modeling of two of the glaciers indicates that, if changing ice extent was driven only by temperature and insolation changes, temperature depressions of 5.0 and 5.1 degrees C from modern conditions, with an uncertainty of approximately +1.5/ 1.0 degrees C, would have sustained the glaciers in mass-balance equilibrium at their LLGM extents. Doubling or halving of modern precipitation during the LLGM would have been associated with 2.7-3.0 degrees C and 6.9-7.0 degrees C temperature depression respectively. Approximately half of the subsequent LLGM to-modern climate change was accomplished by similar to 14 ka. If the rapid main phase of deglaciation between about 16 ka and 14 ka was driven solely by temperature and insolation changes, it would have been associated with a temperature rise of about 2.5 degrees C, at a mean rate of approximately 1.1 degrees C/ky. This new chronology of the last glaciation is generally consistent with others developed recently in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The numerical modeling, however, suggests a lesser LLGM temperature depression from modern conditions than have most previous studies in Colorado. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: Quantifying the local and regional impacts of speciated mercury (Hg) emissions from major urban and industrial areas is critical for understanding Hg transport and cycling in the environment. The Chicago/Gary urban area is one location where Hg emissions from industrial sources are significant and the regional transport of emissions may contribute to elevated ambient Hg concentrations at downwind locations. From July to November 2007, we collected semi-continuous measurements of gaseous elemental Hg (Hg0), fine particulate bound Hg (Hgp), and divalent reactive gaseous Hg (RGM) in Chicago, IL and Holland, MI to characterize the impact of Chicago/Gary source emissions on Hg concentrations in southwest Michigan and to improve our overall understanding of speciated Hg transport and deposition. The mean (and median) concentrations of Hg0, Hgp, and RGM in Chicago were 2.5ng/m3 (1.9ng/m3), 9pg/m3 (5pg/m3), and 17pg/m3 (6pg/m3), respectively. In Holland the mean (and median) concentrations were 1.3ng/m3 (1.3ng/m3), 6pg/m3 (6pg/m3), and 8pg/m3 (2pg/m3), respectively. Cluster analysis of 24-hour HYSPLIT back-trajectories associated with the semi-continuous Hg measurements indicated that southwest transport from Chicago/Gary to Holland occurred during approximately 27% of the study. In Holland, under this transport regime, we observed a five-fold increase in RGM relative to the median concentration of the other transport clusters. We applied the HYSPLIT dispersion model to two case study periods to further quantify the impact of Chicago/Gary sources on southeast Michigan and investigate the role of direct transport and dispersion of speciated Hg emissions. Results suggested that more than 50% of the maximum RGM concentrations observed in Holland during the selected periods could be attributed to direct transport of primary RGM emissions from Chicago/Gary. The remaining RGM fractions are believed to be associated with Hg0 oxidation during transport over Lake Michigan.

    schema:about "Abstract: From August 4, 2007 to August 31, 2009, we collected event-based precipitation samples for mercury (Hg) and trace element analyses at four sites in Illinois (IL), USA. The objectives of these measurements were to quantify Hg wet deposition across the state, and to assess the contributions to Hg in precipitation from major local and regional emission sources. Monitoring sites were located, from north to south, in Chicago, Peoria, Nilwood, and Carbondale, IL. Measurements from these four sites demonstrated that a clear spatial gradient in Hg wet deposition was not evident across the state. Each site received>10?gm-2 of Hg wet deposition annually, and these observed values were comparable to annual Hg wet deposition measurements from other event-based precipitation monitoring sites in source-impacted areas of the Midwestern U.S. We applied the multivariate statistical receptor model, Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA PMF v3.0), to the measured Hg and trace element wet deposition amounts at the four sites. Results suggested that 50% to 74% of total Hg wet deposition at each site could be attributed to coal combustion emissions. The other source signatures identified in the precipitation compositions included cement manufacturing, mixed metal smelting/waste incineration, iron?steel production, and a phosphorus source. We also applied a hybrid receptor model, Quantitative Transport Bias Analysis (QTBA), to the Hg wet deposition datasets to identify the major source regions associated with the measured values. The calculated QTBA probability fields suggested that transport from urban/industrial areas, such as Chicago/Gary, St. Louis, and the Ohio River Valley, resulted in some of the highest estimated event-based Hg wet deposition amounts at the four sites (potential mass transfer of up to 0.32?gm-2). The combined application of PMF and QTBA supported the hypothesis that local and regional coal combustion was the largest source of Hg wet deposition in Illinois.

    schema:about "The anthropogenic emission and subsequent deposition of heavy metals including mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) present human health and environmental concerns. Although it is known that local and regional sources of these metals contribute to deposition in the Great Lakes region, it is difficult to trace emissions from point sources to impacted sites. Recent studies suggest that metal isotope ratios may be useful for distinguishing between and tracing source emissions. We measured Pb, strontium (Sr), and Hg isotope ratios in daily precipitation samples that were collected at seven sites across the Great Lakes region between 2003 and 2007. Lead isotope ratios ( 207 Pb/ 206 Pb = 0.8062 to 0.8554) suggest that Pb deposition was influenced by coal combustion and processing of Mississippi Valley-Type Pb ore deposits. Regional differences in Sr isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.70859 to 0.71155) are likely related to coal fly ash and soil dust. Mercury isotope ratios (d 202 Hg = - 1.13 to 0.13?) also varied among the sites, likely due to regional differences in coal isotopic composition, and fractionation occurring within industrial facilities and in the atmosphere. These data represent the first combined characterization of Pb, Sr, and Hg isotope ratios in precipitation collected across the Great Lakes region. We demonstrate the utility of multiple metal isotope ratios in parallel with traditional trace element multivariate statistical modeling to enable more complete pollution source attribution.

    schema:about "Utilizing variation across U.S. state abortion restrictions on minors and different levels of provider availability, we measure whether women under the age of 25 are less careful in using contraception if abortions are less costly, in terms of both financial and opportunity cost. The effects of abortion restrictions for minors are largest and the most significant for women aged 18 and younger, and the effect of these restrictions decrease in magnitude and significance gradually as women age. As the percent of the state's women without a provider increases, abortions are more difficult to obtain, and women are more likely to use the pill. When a larger percentage of women have a provider, abortions are more easily obtained, and there is a negative effect on pill usage. These results indicate that young women are forward thinking when making their contraceptive decisions, relative to the direct and indirect restrictions on abortion access.

    schema:about "This paper examines the extent to which product liability risk contributes to the high costs of pharmaceuticals in the United States relative to prices in the United Kingdom. Research on pharmaceutical prices rarely accounts for the impact of liability risk, and none that we are aware of compares the United States and United Kingdom. Drawing on a dataset of 77 brand name drugs sold in both the U.S. and the U.K., we analyze relative manufacturers' factory prices in each nation. We utilize several proxies for liability risk including drug litigation history, the percentage of plaintiff wins, and controlled substance classification. Importantly, under U.S. law there are no caps on the amount that can be awarded to a plaintiff claiming economic losses in the U.S. However, payouts in the U.K. are limited. Accounting for market differences and regulatory environments, we find liability risk can account for a portion of the price differential that exists between the U.S. and U.K., warranting further investigation.

Efficient, reliable, and green synthetic methods to produce cyclic hydroxamic acids are needed. Herein, flow hydrogenation has been explored as a novel approach toward achieving the selective partial reduction of 2-nitrophenylacetic acid to 1-hydroxyindolin-2-one. The bidentate ligand, 1,10-phenanthroline, has been identified as a unique inhibitor for modulating product selectivity in this Pt/C-catalyzed process. Under the newly optimized reaction conditions, the targeted hydroxamic acid is produced with high selectivity (49:1) over the lactam by-product. The scope of the reaction is demonstrated for a variety of 2-nitrophenylacetic acid derivatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "We present an integrative model predicting associations among epiphytism, the tank habit, entangling seeds, C-3 vs. CAM photosynthesis, avian pollinators, life in fertile, moist montane habitats, and net rates of species diversification in the monocot family Bromeliaceae. We test these predictions by relating evolutionary shifts in form, physiology, and ecology to time and ancestral distributions, quantifying patterns of correlated and contingent evolution among pairs of traits and analyzing the apparent impact of individual traits on rates of net species diversification and geographic expansion beyond the ancestral Guayana Shield. All predicted patterns of correlated evolution were significant, and the temporal and spatial associations of phenotypic shifts with orogenies generally accorded with predictions. Net rates of species diversification were most closely coupled to life in fertile, moist, geographically extensive cordilleras, with additional significant ties to epiphytism, avian pollination, and the tank habit. The highest rates of net diversification were seen in the bromelioid tank-epiphytic clade (D-crown = 1.05 My(-1)), associated primarily with the Serra do Mar and nearby ranges of coastal Brazil, and in the core tillandsioids (D-crown = 0.67 My(-1)), associated primarily with the Andes and Central America. Six large-scale adaptive radiations and accompanying pulses of speciation account for 86% of total species richness in the family. This study is among the first to test a priori hypotheses about the relationships among phylogeny, phenotypic evolution, geographic spread, and net species diversification, and to argue for causality to flow from functional diversity to spatial expansion to species diversity.

    schema:about "Though considerable progress has been made in inferring phylogenetic relationships of many plant lineages, deep unresolved nodes remain a common problem that can impact downstream efforts, including taxonomic decision-making and character reconstruction. The Core Goodeniaceae is a group affected by this issue: data from the plastid regions trnL-trnF and matK have been insufficient to generate adequate support at key nodes along the backbone of the phylogeny. We performed genome skimming for 24 taxa representing major clades within Core Goodeniaceae. The plastome coding regions (CDS) and nuclear ribosomal repeats (NRR) were assembled and complemented with additional accessions sequenced for nuclear G3PDH and plastid trnL-trnF and matk. The CDS, NRR, and G3PDH alignments were analyzed independently and topology tests were used to detect the alignments' ability to reject alternative topologies. The CDS, NRR, and G3PDH alignments independently supported a Brunonia (Scaevola s.l. (Coopernookia (Goodenia s.l.))) backbone topology, but within Goodenia s.l., the strongly-supported plastome topology (Goodenia A (Goodenia B (Velleia + Goodenia C))) contrasts with the poorly supported nuclear topology ((Goodenia A + Goodenia B) (Velleia + Goodenia C)). A fully resolved and maximally supported topology for Core Goodeniaceae was recovered from the plastome CDS, and there is excellent support for most of the major clades and relationships among them in all alignments. The composition of these seven major clades renders many of the current taxonomic divisions non-monophyletic, prompting us to suggest that Goodenia may be split into several segregate genera.

This study employs a 2-D coupled mass/energy balance and flow model to assess the magnitudes of temperature and precipitation change that could have sustained the glacier in mass-balance equilibrium at its maximum extent during the Bull Lake glaciation. Variable substrate effects on glacier flow and ice thickness make the modeling somewhat more complex than in geologically simpler settings. Model results indicate that a temperature depression of about 6.7 degrees C compared with the present (1971-2000 AD) would have been necessary to sustain the Snowmass Creek glacier in mass-balance equilibrium during the Bull Lake glaciation, assuming no change in precipitation amount or seasonality. A 50% increase or decrease from modern precipitation would have been coupled with 5.2 degrees C and 9.1 degrees C Bull Lake temperature depressions respectively. Uncertainty in these modeled temperature depressions is about 1 degrees C. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "In North America, terrestrial records of biodiversity and climate change that span Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 are rare. Where found, they provide insight into how the coupling of the ocean-atmosphere system is manifested in biotic and environmental records and how the biosphere responds to climate change. In 2010-2011, construction at Ziegler Reservoir near Snowmass Village, Colorado (USA) revealed a nearly continuous, lacustrine/wetland sedimentary sequence that preserved evidence of past plant communities between similar to 140 and 55 lea, including all of MIS 5. At an elevation of 2705 m, the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site also contained thousands of well-preserved bones of late Pleistocene megafauna, including mastodons, mammoths, ground sloths, horses, camels, deer, bison, black bear, coyotes, and bighorn sheep. In addition, the site contained more than 26,000 bones from at least 30 species of small animals including salamanders, otters, muskrats, minks, rabbits, beavers, frogs, lizards, snakes, fish, and birds. The combination of macro- and micro-vertebrates, invertebrates, terrestrial and aquatic plant macrofossils, a detailed pollen record, and a robust, directly dated stratigraphic framework shows that high-elevation ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado are climatically sensitive and varied dramatically throughout MIS 5.

    schema:about "In the last years of the eighteenth century, Egypt famously witnessed the practice of European sciences as embodied in the members of Bonaparte's Commission des sciences et des arts and the newly founded Institut d'Egypte. Less well known are the activities of local eighteenth-century Cairene religious scholars and military elites who were both patrons and practitioners of scientific expertise and producers of hundreds upon hundreds of manuscripts. Through the writings of the French naturalist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1844) and those of the Cairene scholar and chronicler (c)Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti (1753-1825), I explore Egypt as a site for the practice of the sciences in the late eighteenth century, the palatial urban houses which the French made home to the Institut d'Egypte and their role before the French invasion, and the conception of the relationship between the sciences and social politics that each man sought. Ultimately, I argue that Geoffroy's struggle to create scientific neutrality in the midst of intensely tumultuous political realities came to a surprising head with his fixation on Paris as the site for the practice of natural history, while al-Jabarti's embrace of this entanglement of knowledge and power led to a vision of scientific expertise that was specifically located in his Cairene society, but which - as Geoffroy himself demonstrated - could be readily adapted almost anywhere." ;

    schema:about "This study aims to identify those factors that impact the comprehensiveness of state human trafficking legislation. To do so, we propose independent effects of policy diffusion and the percentage of females in a state legislature. Building on this framework, we then suggest a process of gendered diffusion, whereby female state legislators represent a unique diffusion network for \"women's interest\" issues both within their own legislature, as well as across state networks. Taken together, this paper suggests that, for certain types of new issue areas, the demographic composition of state legislative chambers and the policy diffusion process are conditional on one another. This finding extends the bodies of scholarship concerning descriptive representation and policy diffusion, and presents a novel way to look at the policy-making process." ;

    schema:about "People often assume that everyone can be divided by sex/gender (that is, by physical and social characteristics having to do with maleness and femaleness) into two tidy categories: male and female. Careful thought, however, leads us to reject that simple 'binary' picture, since not all people fall precisely into one group or the other. But if we do not think of sex/gender in terms of those two categories, how else might we think of it? Here I consider four distinct models; each model correctly captures some features of sex/gender, and so each is appropriate in some contexts. But the first three models are inadequate when tough questions arise, like whether trans women should be admitted as students at a women's college or when it is appropriate for intersex athletes to compete in women's athletic events. ('Trans' refers to the wide range of people who have an atypical gender identity for someone of their birth-assigned sex, and 'intersex' refers to people whose bodies naturally develop with markedly different physical sex characteristics than are paradigmatic of either men or women.) Such questions of inclusion and exclusion matter enormously to the people whose lives are affected by them, but ordinary notions of sex/gender offer few answers. The fourth model I describe is especially designed to make those hard decisions easier by providing a process to clarify what matters.

    schema:about "Rising pharmaceutical prices, increasing demand for more effective innovative drugs and growing public outrage have heightened criticism of the pharmaceutical industry. The public debate has focused on drug prices and access. As a consequence, the patent system is being reexamined as an efficient mechanism for encouraging pharmaceutical innovation and drug development. We propose an alternative to the existing patent system, instead rewarding the innovating firm with direct tax credits in exchange for marginal cost pricing. This concept is based on the fundamental assumption that innovation that benefits society at large may be financed publicly. As an industry which produces a social good characterized by high fixed costs, high information and regulatory costs, and relatively low marginal costs of production, pharmaceuticals are well-suited to such a mechanism. Under this proposal, drug prices fall, consumer surplus increases, access is enhanced, and the incentives to innovate are preserved." ;

    schema:about "Cambrian biostratigraphy of the Indian subcontinent is best documented from the Parahio Formation of the Tethyan Himalaya. Recently established trilobite biostratigraphy shows that the formation encompasses the latest part of unnamed Stage 4 and much of unnamed Stage 5. A variety of small shelly fossils have been recovered via acid digestion of carbonate beds and include tetract and pentact hexactinellid sponge spicules, chancelloriid spicules belonging to Chancelloria sp. and a new species, Archiasterella dhiraji, shells of an helcionelloid comparable to Igorella maidipingensis, a meraspid ptychopariid trilobite, the tubular Cupitheca sp., a poorly preserved hyolith, and an assortment of spinose microfossils of uncertain affinity. These newly recovered microfossils are consistent with the trilobite-based lower and middle Cambrian age determination and do not support a late Cambrian age for the top of the Parahio Formation advocated in some recent literature. The microfossils reported herein significantly expand the known diversity of such fossils from Cambrian strata in the Himalayan region, and allow for comparison of this fauna with others from Gondwanaland and elsewhere. Integration with trilobite data indicate that the stratigraphic ranges of many small shelly fossils described in this study are greater than previously recognized." ;

    schema:about "The electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) deposition of crystalline germanium (Ge) in a eutectic mixture of liquid gallium (Ga) and indium (In) was analyzed as a function of liquid metal thickness, process temperature, and flux. Through control of reaction parameters, conditions were identified that allow selective nucleation and growth of crystalline Ge at the interface between e-GaIn and a crystalline Si substrate. The crystal growth rates of Ge by ec-LLS as a function of process temperatures were obtained from time-dependent powder X-ray diffraction measurements of crystalline Ge. The driving force, ?µ, for crystal formation in ec-LLS was estimated through analyses of the experimental data in conjunction with predictions from a finite-difference model. The required ?µ for Ge nucleation was tantamount to a supersaturation approximately 10² larger than the equilibrium concentration of Ge in e-GaIn at the investigated temperatures. These points are discussed both in the context of advancing new, low-temperature synthetic methodologies for crystalline semiconductor films and on understanding semiconductor crystal growth more deeply.

    schema:about "Highly ordered crystallineGe microwire arrays with individual diameters larger than 1 µm have been grown in aqueous solutions at ambient pressure and below the boiling point of water through anelectrochemical liquid–liquid–solid (ec-LLS) crystal growth process. A pertinent feature of this work is the use of a liquid metal patterning strategy which combines the utility of photolithography with the simplicity of doctor blading to produce macroscopic (&gt;1cm2) arrays of liquid metal microelectrodes. Optical and electronmicrographs showed the compatibility of the liquid metal patterning process and subsequent ec-LLS microwire growth with a wide assortment of different conductive substrates, including silicon, indium tinoxide, copper foil, titanium foil, stainless steel, and poly[(3,4-ethylenedioxy)thiophene]/poly(styrenesulfonate). Furthermore, a simple chemical bath lift-off procedure was developed to fully remove the Ge microwire arrays embedded in SU-8 photoresistwithout perturbing the order or quality of the material, resulting in a free-standing composite membrane. Data from energy-dispersive spectroscopy, Auger nanoprobe spectroscopic mapping, and four-terminal single microwire electrical measurements indicated that the specific liquid metal used for ec-LLS impacts the morphology and electrical properties of the resultant Ge microwires.

    schema:about "We use measurements made onboard the National Science Foundation's C-130 research aircraft during the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) experiment to examine total Hg (THg) emission ratios (EmRs) for six coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in the southeastern U.S. We compare observed enhancement ratios (ERs) with EmRs calculated using Hg emissions data from two inventories: the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). For four CFPPs, our measured ERs are strongly correlated with EmRs based on the 2011 NEI (rÂ² = 0.97), although the inventory data exhibit a -39% low bias. Our measurements agree best (to within Â±32%) with the NEI Hg data when the latter were derived from on-site emissions measurements. Conversely, the NEI underestimates by approximately 1 order of magnitude the ERs we measured for one previously untested CFPP. Measured ERs are uncorrelated with values based on the 2013 TRI, which also tends to be biased low. Our results suggest that the Hg inventories can be improved by targeting CFPPs for which the NEI- and TRI-based EmRs have significant disagreements. We recommend that future versions of the Hg inventories should provide greater traceability and uncertainty estimates.

    schema:about "The kynurenine pathway is responsible for the metabolism of more than 95% of dietary tryptophan (TRP) and produces numerous bioactive metabolites. Recent studies have focused on three enzymes in this pathway: indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO1), kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), and kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II). IDO1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, and these agents may also have therapeutic utility in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis. KMO inhibitors are being investigated as potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntingtons and Alzheimers diseases. KAT II inhibitors have been proposed in new therapeutic approaches toward psychiatric and cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Numerous medicinal chemistry studies are currently aimed at the design of novel, potent, and selective inhibitors for each of these enzymes. The emerging opportunities and significant challenges associated with pharmacological modulation of these enzymes will be explored in this review." ;

    schema:about "The direct preparation of crystalline indium antimonide (InSb) by the electrodeposition of antimony (Sb) onto indium (In) working electrodes has been demonstrated. When Sb is electrodeposited from dilute aqueous electrolytes containing dissolved Sb2O3, an alloying reaction is possible between Sb and In if any surface oxide films are first thoroughly removed from the electrode. The presented Raman spectra detail the interplay between the formation of crystalline InSb and the accumulation of Sb as either amorphous or crystalline aggregates on the electrode surface as a function of time, temperature, potential, and electrolyte composition. Electron and optical microscopies confirm that under a range of conditions, the preparation of a uniform and phase-pure InSb film is possible. The cumulative results highlight this methodology as a simple yet potent strategy for the synthesis of intermetallic compounds of interest.

    schema:about "Atmospheric deposition is a primary pathway by which mercury (Hg) enters terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; however, the chemical and meteorological processes that Hg undergoes from emission to deposition are not well understood. Hg stable isotope geochemistry is a growing field used to better understand Hg biogeochemical cycling. To examine the atmospheric Hg isotopic composition in the Great Lakes, precipitation and ambient vapor-phase Hg samples were collected in Chicago, IL, Holland, MI, and Dexter, MI, between April 2007 and September 2009. Precipitation samples were characterized by negative mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) (d202Hg=-0.79‰ to 0.18‰), while most vapor-phase samples displayed positive MDF (d202Hg=-0.59‰ to 0.43‰). Positive mass-independent fractionation (MIF) (?199Hg=0.04‰ to 0.52‰) was observed in precipitation, whereas MIF was slightly negative in vapor-phase samples (?199Hg=-0.21‰ to 0.06‰). Significant positive MIF of 200Hg up to 0.25‰ was also measured in precipitation. Such MIF of an even-mass Hg isotope has not been previously reported in natural samples. These results contrast with recent predictions of the isotopic composition of atmospheric Hg and suggest that, in addition to aqueous photoreduction, other atmospheric redox reactions and source-related processes may contribute to isotopic fractionation of atmospheric Hg.

    schema:about "Crystalline GaAs (c-GaAs) has been prepared directly through electroreduction of As2O3 dissolved in an alkaline aqueous solution at a liquid gallium (Ga(l)) electrode at modest temperatures (T = 80 ?C). Ga(l) pool electrodes yielded consistent electrochemical behavior, affording repetitive measurements that illustrated the interdependences of applied potential, concentration of dissolved As2O3, and electrodeposition temperature on the quality of the resultant c-GaAs(s). Raman spectra indicated the composition of the resultant film was strongly dependent on both the electrodeposition temperature and dissolved concentration of As2O3 but not to the applied bias. For electrodepositions performed either at room temperature or with high (=0.01 M) concentrations of dissolved As2O3, Raman spectra of the electrodeposited films were consistent with amorphous As(s). X-ray diffractograms of As(s) films collected after thermal annealing indicated metallurgical alloying occurred only at temperatures in excess of 200 C. Optical images and Raman spectra separately showed the composition of the as-electrodeposited film in dilute (=0.001 M) solutions of dissolved As2O3(aq) was pure c-GaAs(s) at much lower temperatures than 200 C. Diffractograms and transmission electron microscopy performed on as-prepared films confirmed the identity of c-GaAs(s). The collective results thus provide the first clear demonstration of an electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) process involving a liquid metal that serves simultaneously as an electrode, a solvent/medium for crystal growth, and a coreactant for the synthesis of a polycrystalline semiconductor. The presented data serve as impetus for the further development of the ec-LLS process as a controllable, simple, and direct route for technologically important optoelectronic materials such as c-GaAs(s).

The ec-LPE method uniquely blends the simplicity and control of traditional electrodeposition with the material quality of melt growth. A new electrochemical cell design based on the compression of a liquid metal electrode into a thin cavity that enables ec-LPE is described. The epitaxial nature, low strain character, and crystallographic defect content of the resultant solid Ge films were analyzed by electron backscatter diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, high resolution X-ray diffraction, and electron channeling contrast imaging. The results here show the first step toward a manufacturing infrastructure for traditional crystalline inorganic semiconductor epifilms that does not require high temperature, gaseous precursors, or complex apparatus.

    schema:about "\"On-off\" phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD) are unpredictable motor fluctuations associated with long-term levodopa use. Mood fluctuations have been found to coincide with the motor fluctuations in that depression and anxiety increase while the person with PD is in the \"off\" state. What has been relatively unexplored is whether those persons with PD who have \"on-off\" phenomena differ psychologically in fundamental ways from those who do not have \"on-off\" phenomena. In the present study, depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed in 36 persons with PD (n = 14 with \"on-off\" phenomena, n = 22 without \"on-off\" phenomena). All those with \"on-off\" phenomena were assessed in their \"on\" state. Those persons with PD with \"on-off\" phenomena had significantly higher levels of anxiety than those without \"on-off\" phenomena. However, both groups, regardless of \"on-off\" status, were mildly depressed. Neurobiological interpretations of the results implicate the locus coeruleus in the pathogenesis of both \"on-off\" phenomena and anxiety, whereas psychological interpretations of the results involve the issues of learned helplessness and control over health symptoms in PD." ;

    schema:about "This study compared performance of 15- to 17-month-old Ts65Dn mice to that of littermate controls on an automated sustained attention task in which the location, onset time, and duration of brief visual cues varied unpredictably. Ts65Dn mice committed more omission errors than controls, particularly on trials with the briefest cues. Videotape data revealed that the trisomic mice attended less than controls during the period before cue presentation and engaged in stereotypic jumping and grooming immediately after making an error. These findings reveal that Ts65Dn mice are impaired in sustaining attention and exhibit heightened reactivity to committing an error, and support the validity of this mouse model for studying Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. The attention task, coupled with the videotape analyses of task performance, provides a useful paradigm for studying attention and reactivity to errors in mice.

    schema:about "Categorical perception (CP) refers to the influence of category knowledge on perception and is revealed by a superior ability to discriminate items across categories relative to items within a category. In recent years, the finding that CP is lateralized to the left hemisphere in adults has been interpreted as evidence for a kind of CP driven by language. The present research challenges this conclusion. In 2 experiments, we found that CP for novel object categories was stronger in the left hemisphere than in the right, consistent with a role for language. However, both labeled and unlabeled categories gave rise to such effects, and to comparable degrees. These results suggest that left-lateralized CP does not depend on language but rather may reflect the left hemisphere's more general propensity for categorical processing. Our findings raise implications for research on linguistic relativity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

    schema:about "The ability to upregulate cognitive control in motivationally salient situations was examined in individuals with schizophrenia (patients) and healthy controls. Fifty-four patients and 39 healthy controls were recruited. A computerized monetary response conflict task required participants to identity a picture, over which was printed a matching (congruent), neutral, or incongruent word. This baseline condition was followed by an incentive condition, in which participants were given the opportunity to win money on reward-cued trials. These reward-cued trials were interleaved with nonreward cued trials. Reaction times (RT) were examined for both incentive context effects (difference in RT between baseline and nonreward cue trials in the incentive condition) and incentive cue effects (difference in RT between nonreward and reward cue trials in the incentive condition). Compared with baseline, controls showed a speeding of responses during both the nonreward (incentive context effect) and reward cued (incentive cue effect) trials during the incentive condition, but with a larger incentive context than incentive cue effect, suggesting a reliance on proactive control strategies. Although patients also showed a speeding of responses to both nonreward and reward cued trials, they showed a significantly smaller incentive context effect than controls, suggesting a reduction in the use of proactive control and a greater reliance on the use of \"just-in-time,\" reactive control strategies. These results are discussed in light of the relationship between motivation and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia," ;

    schema:about "The placebo effect is any outcome that is not attributed to a specific treatment but rather to an individual's mindset (Benson & Friedman, 1996). This phenomenon can extend beyond its typical use in pharmaceutical drugs to involve aspects of everyday life, such as the effect of sleep on cognitive functioning. In 2 studies examining whether perceived sleep quality affects cognitive functioning, 164 participants reported their previous night's sleep quality. They were then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sleep quality conditions or 2 control conditions. Those in the \"above average\" sleep quality condition were informed that they had spent 28.7% of their total sleep time in REM, whereas those in the \"below average\" sleep quality condition were informed that they had only spent 16.2% of their time in REM sleep. Assigned sleep quality but not self-reported sleep quality significantly predicted participants' scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Controlled Oral Word Association Task. Assigned sleep quality did not predict participants' scores on the Digit Span task, as expected, nor did it predict scores on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which was unexpected. The control conditions showed that the findings were not due to demand characteristics from the experimental protocol. These findings supported the hypothesis that mindset can influence cognitive states in both positive and negative directions, suggesting a means of controlling one's health and cognition." ;

    schema:about "In the aftermath of the war in northern Uganda, former soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) face many challenges reintegrating into their communities. Former LRA soldiers often return home with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may exacerbate the social stigma of being in the LRA. Health professional and lay community members; (N = 119) attitudes toward former LRA soldiers with symptoms of PTSD were examined and compared with attitudes toward civilian victims with the same symptoms, both depicted in vignettes. It was hypothesized that there would be a greater negative bias toward former soldiers due to the dual stigma of involvement with the LRA and mental illness, particularly among lay participants who lacked education regarding the prognoses and treatment of the mentally ill. Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant difference in participants' attitudes toward the vignettes of LRA soldiers and civilian victims. Lay participants were less stigmatizing than health professionals and trainees on both measures of stigma: social distance and skill assessment. These findings suggest that the relationship between health education and stigma is complex in Uganda and different from what is found in most western research. Implications for research, treatment, and reintegration are discussed as Uganda moves forward. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "In our opinion Jonathan Lear is one of the most significant American thinkers in the first decades of the 21st Century. In his brilliant and seamless fusion of philosophy and psychoanalysis he has presented such a startlingly original concept of the human psyche and what is comprised in 'a distinctively human life' that it constitutes a novel and compelling human ontology. We present this ontology by attempting to unify Jonathan Lear's ideas from his first great psychoanalytic work, Love and its Place in Nature, through his most recent work on irony and psychic integrity. We explicate Lear's brilliant reformulation of Freud's theory of development, his critique of the Western attempt to overly organize the psyche to defend against psychic and social disruption, and his postmodern advocacy of 'living without a principle.' We conclude by showing how developing the virtues of courage and hope with a disposition to irony are the keys to becoming a person who can integrate the disparate parts of the psyche, engage in meaningful self-inquiry, and live in a vibrant openness to new possibilities. In sum, we attempt to show through Lear's work that it is only by living with both a psychoanalytic knowledge of the depths of the psyche and ways to access this depth that one can realize the possibilities of one's humanity to the fullest degree.

    schema:about "Approximately 8% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to come from land-use change(1), but this estimate excludes fluxes of terrestrial carbon to aquatic ecosystems from human disturbance. Carbon fluxes from land to rivers have probably increased by 0.1 to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year as a result of disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural intensification and the injection of human wastewater(2). Most dissolved organic carbon in rivers originates from young organic carbon from soils and vegetation(3), but aged carbon removed from the modern carbon cycle is also exported in many systems. Here we analyse a global data set of radiocarbon ages of riverine dissolved organic carbon and spatial data on land cover, population and environmental variables. We find that the age of dissolved organic carbon in rivers increases with population density and the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a watershed, and decreases with annual precipitation. We reason that disturbance reintroduces aged soil organic matter into the modern carbon cycle, although fossil carbon in fertilizer or petroleum products may also be a source of aged carbon in disturbed watersheds. The total export from the terrestrial environment to freshwater systems remains unknown; nevertheless, our results suggest that 3-9% of dissolved organic carbon in rivers is aged carbon mobilized by human disturbance." ;

In an effort to view Ladakh's multicultural history from a paternal genetic perspective, we performed a high-resolution Y-chromosomal survey of Ladakh, within the context of Y haplogroup and haplotype distributions of 41 Asian reference populations. The results of this investigation highlight the rich ethnic and genetic diversity of Ladkah which includes genetic contributions from disparate regions of the continent including, West, East, South and Central Asia. The phylogenetic signals from Ladakh are consistent with the Indo-Aryans' occupation during the Neolithic age and its historic connection with Tibet, as well as the East-West gene flow associated with the Silk Road." ;

In this study, for the first time, we attempt to alleviate this lacuna of knowledge by comprehensively investigating the Y chromosome composition of contemporary Mayan populations throughout their domain. To accomplish this, five geographically targeted and ethnically distinct Mayan populations are investigated using Y-SNP and Y-STR markers. Findings: overall, the Mayan populations as a group are highly homogeneous, basically made up of only two autochthonous haplogroups, Q1a2a1a1*-M3 and Q1a2a1*-L54. Although the Y-STR data illustrates diversity, this diversity, for the most part, is uniformly distributed among geographically distant Mayan populations. Similar haplotypes among populations, abundance of singletons and absence of population partitioning within networks among Mayan populations suggest recent population expansion and substantial gene flow within the Mayan dominion, possibly due to the development of agriculture, the establishment of interacting City-State systems and commerce." ;

    schema:about "A hallmark of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin, conserved from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, is its ability to spread to adjacent genomic regions(1-6). Central to heterochromatin spread is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin, oligomerizes and forms a versatile platform that participates in diverse nuclear functions, ranging from gene silencing to chromosome segregation(1-6). How HP1 proteins assemble on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome complex achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated nucleosomes drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a spreading-competent state. In the auto-inhibited state, a histonemimic sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks methyl-mark recognition by the chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition is relieved by recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends appear exposed. Disruption of the switch between the auto-inhibited and spreading-competent states disrupts heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing in vivo. These findings are reminiscent of other conditionally activated polymerization processes, such as actin nucleation, and open up a new class of regulatory mechanisms that operate on chromatin in vivo." ;

    schema:about "Williams syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by an uncommon hypersociability and a mosaic of retained and compromised linguistic and cognitive abilities. Nearly all clinically diagnosed individuals with Williams syndrome lack precisely the same set of genes, with breakpoints in chromosome band 7q11.23 (refs 1-5). The contribution of specific genes to the neuroanatomical and functional alterations, leading to behavioural pathologies in humans, remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate neural progenitor cells and cortical neurons derived from Williams syndrome and typically developing induced pluripotent stem cells. Neural progenitor cells in Williams syndrome have an increased doubling time and apoptosis compared with typically developing neural progenitor cells. Using an individual with atypical Williams syndrome(6,7), we narrowed this cellular phenotype to a single gene candidate, frizzled 9 (FZD9). At the neuronal stage, layer V/VI cortical neurons derived from Williams syndrome were characterized by longer total dendrites, increased numbers of spines and synapses, aberrant calcium oscillation and altered network connectivity. Morphometric alterations observed in neurons from Williams syndrome were validated after Golgi staining of postmortem layer V/VI cortical neurons. This model of human induced pluripotent stem cells(8) fills the current knowledge gap in the cellular biology of Williams syndrome and could lead to further insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the disorder and the human social brain." ;

    schema:about "T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual(1-4). Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCR beta chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands." ;

    schema:about "The MS2-MCP system enables researchers to image multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle with high temporal and spatial resolution. However, for short-lived mRNAs, the tight binding of the MS2 coat protein (MCP) to the MS2 binding sites (MBS) protects the RN A from being efficiently degraded, and this confounds the study of mRNA regulation. Here, we describe a reporter system (MBSV6) with reduced affinity for the MC P, which allows mRNA degradation while preserving single-molecule detection determined by single-molecule FISH (smFISH) or live imaging. Constitutive mRNAs (MDN1 and DOA1) and highly-regulated mRNAs (GAL1 and ASH1) endogenously tagged with MBSV6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae degrade normally. As a result, short-lived mRNAs were imaged throughout their complete life cycle. The MBSV6 reporter revealed that, in contrast to previous findings, coordinated recruitment of mRNAs at specialized structures such as P-bodies during stress did not occur, and mRNA degradation was heterogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm." ;

    schema:about "The debate concerning the origin of the Polynesian speaking peoples has been recently reinvigorated by genetic evidence for secondary migrations to western Polynesia from the New Guinea region during the 2nd millennium BP. Using genome-wide autosomal data from the Leeward Society Islands, the ancient cultural hub of eastern Polynesia, we find that the inhabitants' genomes also demonstrate evidence of this episode of admixture, dating to 1,700-1,200 BP. This supports a late settlement chronology for eastern Polynesia, commencing similar to 1,000 BP, after the internal differentiation of Polynesian society. More than 70% of the autosomal ancestry of Leeward Society Islanders derives from Island Southeast Asia with the lowland populations of the Philippines as the single largest potential source. These long-distance migrants into Polynesia experienced additional admixture with northern Melanesians prior to the secondary migrations of the 2nd millennium BP. Moreover, the genetic diversity of mtDNA and Y chromosome lineages in the Leeward Society Islands is consistent with linguistic evidence for settlement of eastern Polynesia proceeding from the central northern Polynesian outliers in the Solomon Islands. These results stress the complex demographic history of the Leeward Society Islands and challenge phylogenetic models of cultural evolution predicated on eastern Polynesia being settled from Samoa." ;

    schema:about "In several models of pathogenesis, Salmonella requires genes encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) for virulence. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium ), most SPI-1 genes are arranged in operons and are co-ordinately regulated in response to environmental signals via the SPI-1-encoded protein HilA. In order to understand how HilA controls the transcription of SPI-1 genes, we have analysed the invF and prgH promoters. We have reconstituted HilA-dependent activation of both promoters in Escherichia coli by supplying hilA on a plasmid, strongly suggesting that HilA acts directly on the promoters. By analysing the HilA-dependent activity of deletions and mutations in P invF , we identified cis elements necessary for HilA-dependent activation. Through biochemical studies, we have defined a probable HilA-binding sequence in the invF promoter. This ?HilA box? is intact in the minimal promoter identified through deletion analysis, and it is disrupted in one class of P invF mutants that has reduced activation by HilA. The prgH promoter also contains a HilA box in the same position relative to the +1 of transcription. This work is the first to connect HilA-dependent environmental regulation with a specific sequence in a SPI-1 virulence gene promoter.

    schema:about "Summary Salmonella typhimurium is a Gram-negative enteric pathogen that can infect intestinal epithelial cells and induce inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. These processes are mediated by a type III secretion system (TTSS), which is encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). Previous studies showed that four SPI1-encoded transcriptional regulators, HilD, HilC, HilA and InvF, act in an ordered fashion to co-ordinately activate expression of the SPI1 TTSS. HilD and HilC derepress hilA transcription. HilA activates invF as well as SPI1 genes that encode components of the TTS apparatus. InvF then activates genes that encode proteins secreted by the SPI1 TTS apparatus. In this scheme, HilD and HilC indirectly activate expression of the SPI1 TTS apparatus and its secreted substrates by affecting hilA expression. Here, we report that HilD and HilC can also activate expression of a subset of SPI1 genes independently of HilA. Our studies show that HilD and HilC activate transcription of invF from a promoter that is far upstream of its HilA-dependent promoter. This activation is most probably through direct binding of HilD and HilC to sequences upstream and downstream of this alternative HilA-independent promoter.

    schema:about "We present VLT FORS1 and FORS2 spectra of 39 candidate high-redshift supernovae that were discovered as part of a cosmological study using type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) over a wide range of redshifts. From the spectra alone, 20 candidates are spectrally classified as SNe Ia with redshifts ranging from z=0.212 to z=1.181. Of the remaining 19 candidates, 1 might be a type II supernova and 11 exhibit broad supernova-like spectral features and/or have supernova-like light curves. The candidates were discovered in 8 separate ground-based searches. In those searches in which SNe Ia at zsimilar to0.5 were targeted, over 80% of the observed candidates were spectrally classified as SNe Ia. In those searches in which SNe Ia with z>1 were targeted, 4 candidates with z>1 were spectrally classified as SNe Ia and later followed with ground and space based observatories. We present the spectra of all candidates, including those that could not be spectrally classified as supernova." ;

    schema:about "We present a novel technique for fitting restframe I-band light curves on a data set of 42 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the result of the fit, we construct a Hubble diagram with 26 SNe from the subset at 0.01 < z < 0.1. Adding two SNe at z similar to 0.5 yields results consistent with a flat Lambda-dominated \"concordance universe\" (Omega(M), Omega(Lambda)) = (0.25, 0.75). For one of these, SN 2000fr, new near infrared data are presented. The high redshift supernova NIR data are also used to test for systematic effects in the use of SNe Ia as distance estimators. A flat, Lambda = 0, universe where the faintness of supernovae at z similar to 0.5 is due to grey dust homogeneously distributed in the intergalactic medium is disfavoured based on the high-z Hubble diagram using this small data-set. However, the uncertainties are large and no firm conclusion may be drawn. We explore the possibility of setting limits on intergalactic dust based on B-I and B-V colour measurements, and conclude that about 20 well measured SNe are needed to give statistically significant results. We also show that the high redshift restframe I-band data points are better fit by light curve templates that show a prominent second peak, suggesting that they are not intrinsically underluminous." ;

    schema:about "After the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ended the Mexican American War in 1848, the United States-Mexico border became a site of intense smuggling. Increased smuggling along the South Texas-Mexico border also resulted in the increased policing and militarization of the border. The interrelated practices of militarization, policing and smuggling have become an integral part of an ever-evolving borderlands' existence as many Mexican Americans have sought the opportunity to make a lucrative income as drug smugglers and policing agents. The result is the division of Mexican American peer groups along the border into members of the 'criminal underworld' and the law enforcement agencies that police these criminals. This division has exacerbated tensions in border communities, and it has increasingly come to define the complexities and contradictions of life in the South Texas-Mexico borderlands during the 40-year tenure of the war on drugs. Despite the growing concern over the intensification of drug violence in the borderlands, there has been relatively little effort to critically analyze the social realities of the drug war along the US-Mexico border. In this article, I examine the impact of drug trafficking and drug war policing on a South Texas border community, by reflecting on the experiences of Mexican American drug traffickers, los mafiosos, and Mexican American law enforcement officers, la chota. As the social actors actively engaged in the drug war, the life histories of these drug traffickers and law enforcement officers reveal the detrimental effects of escalating border militarization, and also highlight the 'expendability' of Mexican Americans in the militarized Mexico-United States borderlands.

    schema:about "Increasing demands on nanometer-scale properties of oxide tunnel barriers necessitate a consistent means to assess them on these length scales. Conducting atomic force microscopy (CAFM) is a promising technique both for understanding connections between nanoscale tunnel barrier characteristics and macroscopic device performance as well as for rapid qualitative evaluation of new fabrication methods and materials. Here we report CAFM characterization of aluminum oxide (AlOx) barriers to be used in Josephson-junction qubits, with a particular emphasis on developing reproducible imaging conditions and appropriate interpretation. We find that control of the imaging force is a critical factor for reproducibility. We imaged the same sample on the same day with the same cantilever varying only the imaging force between scans. Statistical properties compiled from the resulting current maps varied approximately exponentially with imaging force, with typical currents increasing by two orders of magnitude for only a factor of 5 increase in imaging force. Given appropriate control of the imaging force, scan to scan variation of the current recorded at the same location was approximately +/-0.5, which establishes a criterion for statistical reproducibility of CAFM measurements. We further find that the appropriate interpretation for CAFM (under most imaging conditions), is as a probe of local propensity for insulator breakdown. Samples stored in air for weeks before study showed current features with oxidation times of order minutes. This indicates that these features were created by the scanning of the tip, and thus represent local pinhole susceptible regions. We finally present results for several AlOx samples showing that under appropriate imaging conditions significant sample to sample variation is observed, thus demonstrating the potential of this technique to qualitatively assess and facilitate under standing of potential qubit tunnel barrier devices.

    schema:about "This paper examines how rural communities in Colorado have confronted military expansion. Against the backdrop of a series of base realignments and closures during the past three decades that have streamlined US military holdings nationwide, the US Army base at Fort Carson, Colorado, has been growing. In 1983 Fort Carson expanded into a 95 500-hectare training area in southeastern Colorado known as the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS). In 2006 the Army announced plans to expand the PCMS by 169 000 hectares. Under the Army's proposal, a significant portion of southeastern Colorado would be transformed into the largest Army training ground in the US. This prospect galvanized a diverse coalition of rural residents to oppose the Pinon Canyon expansion. Our research critically considers how the principal actors in this case-the US Army and a rural citizen opposition coalition-mobilized different narrative and political strategies based substantially upon contrasting cartographic representations to shape the debate and construct contested geographies of this space as military training ground versus open range. As of 2014, the expansion of PCMS is on hold, although there is no guarantee that base or military area expansion will not proceed in the future." ;

    schema:about "Pericentromeric heterochromatin formation is mediated by repressive histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9Me) and its recognition by HP1 proteins. Intriguingly, in many organisms, RNAi is coupled to this process through poorly understood mechanisms. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the H3-K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) ortholog Swi6 are critical for RNAi, whereas RNAi stimulates H3K9Me. In addition to the endoribonuclease Dcr1, RNAi in S. pombe requires two interacting protein complexes, the RITS complex, which contains an Argonaute subunit, and the RDRC complex, which contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit. We previously identified Ers1 (essential for RNAi-dependent silencing) as an orphan protein that genetically acts in the RNAi pathway. Using recombinant proteins, we show here that Ers1 directly and specifically interacts with HP1/Swi6. Two-hybrid assays indicate that Ers1 also directly interacts with several RNAi factors. Consistent with these interactions, Ers1 associates in vivo with the RITS complex, the RDRC complex, and Dcr1, and it promotes interactions between these factors. Ers1, like Swi6, is also required for RNAi complexes to associate with pericentromeric noncoding RNAs. Overexpression of Ers1 results in a dominant-negative phenotype that can be specifically suppressed by increasing levels of the RDRC subunit Hrr1 or of Dcr1, further supporting a functional role for Ers1 in promoting the assembly of the RNAi machinery. Through the interactions described here, Ers1 may promote RNAi by tethering the corresponding enzyme complexes to HP1-coated chromatin, thereby placing them in proximity to the nascent noncoding RNA substrate." ;

    schema:about "It has always been difficult to account for the evolution of certain human characters such as language, empathy, and altruism via individual reproductive success. However, the striatum, a subcortical region originally thought to be exclusively motor, is now known to contribute to social behaviors and \"personality styles\" that may link such complexities with natural selection. We here report that the human striatum exhibits a unique neurochemical profile that differs dramatically from those of other primates. The human signature of elevated striatal dopamine, serotonin, and neuropeptide Y, coupled with lowered acetylcholine, systematically favors externally driven behavior and greatly amplifies sensitivity to social cues that promote social conformity, empathy, and altruism. We propose that selection induced an initial form of this profile in early hominids, which increased their affiliative behavior, and that this shift either preceded or accompanied the adoption of bipedality and elimination of the sectorial canine. We further hypothesize that these changes were critical for increased individual fitness and promoted the adoption of social monogamy, which progressively increased cooperation as well as a dependence on tradition-based cultural transmission. These eventually facilitated the acquisition of language by elevating the reproductive advantage afforded those most sensitive to social cues." ;

    schema:about "B cell lymphoma survival requires tonic or ligand-independent signals through activation of Syk by the B cell receptor. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein latent membrane 2a (LMP2a), a mimic of the B cell receptor, provides constitutive survival signals for latently infected cells through Syk activation; however, the precise downstream mechanisms coordinating this survival response in EBV+ B cell lymphomas remain to be elucidated. Herein, we assess the mechanism of Syk survival signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphomas from post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) to discover virally controlled therapeutic targets involved in lymphomagenesis and tumor progression. Using small molecule inhibition and siRNA strategies, we show that Syk inhibition reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of PTLD-derived EBV+ B cell lines. Syk inhibition also reduces autocrine IL-10 production. Although Syk inhibition attenuates signaling through both the PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways, only PI3K/Akt inhibition causes apoptosis of PTLD-derived cell lines. Loss of the endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP is observed after Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition. The loss of XIAP and apoptosis that results from Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition is reversed by inhibition of the mitochondrial protease HtrA2. Thus, Syk drives EBV+ B cell lymphoma survival through PI3K/Akt activation, which prevents the HtrA2-dependent loss of XIAP. Syk, Akt, and XIAP antagonists may present potential new therapeutic strategies for PTLD through targeting of EBV-driven survival signals.

Sequenc- ing of LMP1 isolated from a panel of EBVsup+] B cell lymphomas identified three different variants of LMP1, each distinct from the B95.8 prototype isoform. All tumor variants of LMP1 as well as the B95.8 LMP1 isoform were able to induce rapid p38 phos- phorylation as well as Akt and JNK activation. Additionally all variants showed similar ability to activate nuclear factor KB. In contrast, only tumor-derived LMP1 variants induced prolonged Erk activation and c-Fos expression. Sequence analysis revealed only two amino acids, 212 and 366, shared by the tumor variants but distinct from B95.8. Point mutation of either amino acids 212 (glycine to serine) or 366 (serine to threonine) from the B95.8 isoform to the tumor variant version of LMP1 was suffi- cient for gain of function characterized by sustained activation of Erk and subsequent c-Fos induction and binding to the APi site. Our results indicate that the enhanced ability of tumor- derived LMP1 to induce and stabilize the c-Fos oncogene can be localized to two amino acids in the C terminus of LMP1.

    schema:about "Financial regulators are challenged with finding the most efficient and effective ways to monitor banks given an expanding and complex international financial system. Market discipline has grown in importance as a way to discourage banks from taking on unnecessary risk. One of the main drivers of market discipline is information disclosure. While the literature on market discipline is expansive, there are no known studies on the impact of individual information disclosure requirements on market discipline. Our study investigates which specific disclosure requirements influence financial investors to discipline banks and which do not. We find that information disclosure requirements primarily reduce or have no impact on market discipline practices.

    schema:about "Students with disabilities continue to be denied literacy rich experiences with their non-disabled peers. Throughout this article the authors explore how narrow, ability-focused teacher dispositions can perpetuate low expectations and can preemptively deny students with disabilities access to meaningful literacy experiences. Hence, the development of an inclusive literacy disposition is crucial to providing access to robust learning experiences for students with disabilities. The authors describe a research study that utilizes journal writing and a role-play intervention with pre-service general educators in a graduate literacy methods course. Analysis of post-intervention data suggests it is possible to shift narrow, ability-orientated dispositions to broader and more inclusive conceptualizations that support students with disabilities. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

    schema:about "Based on fieldwork among the Makhuwa of northern Mozambique, this essay explores how non-Pentecostal models of transformation shape a people's manner of relating to Pentecostalism. Radical change has long been constitutive of Makhuwa history and subjectivity. Yet Makhuwa patterns of change, commonly conceived in terms of movement, entail regress as much as egress - circular mobilities that disrupt linear teleologies. State administrators and Pentecostal missionaries attempt to reform local inhabitants by, respectively, sedentarising' and converting' them. Deploying their historical proclivity towards mobility, those among whom I worked appear simultaneously eager to partake in resettlement schemes and reluctant to remain settled by them. I argue that their ambivalence towards Pentecostal churches and teachings, in particular, challenges two prevailing assumptions within anthropological studies of Christianity: that discontinuity is definitive, and that it is exceptional to Pentecostalism." ;

A nonzero current account provides a mechanism for intertemporal trade, and a country has a comparative advantage in present (or future) goods if its autarky real interest rate is below (or above) the world real interest rate. The authors explain why the intertemporal approach to the current account reaches different conclusions from the traditional approach regarding welfare effects. Also, the authors integrate alternative approaches for explaining the underlying cause(s) of nonzero current account balances." ;

    schema:about "A lack of consensus remains on what should form the theoretical core of the undergraduate intermediate macroeconomic course. In determining how to deal with the Keynesian/classical divide, instructors must decide whether to follow the modern approach of building macroeconomic relationships from micro foundations, or to use the traditional approach based on aggregate models of the macroeconomy. In this article, the authors discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each approach in the context of course objectives. Because there is significant heterogeneity in textbook coverage, the authors summarize some of the approaches taken in current intermediate-level textbooks, which should serve as a useful starting point for new instructors. The authors also discuss how each approach can be extended to analyze the recent recession in the United States." ;

This study examined the effects of ability-based expectations in an experiment in which some participants ('coaches') were assigned false expectations of the basketball free-throw shooting ability of other participants ('players'). Coaches allocated more opportunities to players for whom the false expectation was positive, and fewer shots to players for whom the false expectation was negative. In turn, players who were allocated more shots made a higher percentage of them, thereby confirming their coaches' expectations about their shooting ability, and were more confident in their shooting ability following the task, than players who were allocated fewer shots.

This history provides numerous insights about the value, uses, and misuses of our work.

    schema:about "The dextral-reverse Alpine Fault offsets alluvial terraces of the Maruia River at Calf Paddock. RTK-GPS surveying of the faulted terraces yields detailed measurements of fault slip across terraces T1-T5. Pits were excavated to log the stratigraphy, date the deposits and to thereby constrain fault slip rates for this site. The mean of the four largest dextral offsets across terrace T2 is 12.0 +/- 1.3 m. The corresponding mean vertical offset is 1.6 +/- 0.6 m. A single charcoal date with an age of 1095-1275 cal yr BP is used to derive minimum dextral and reverse slip rates of 10 +/- 2 and 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm/yr, respectively. These rates are comparable with others observed nearby at Little and Lost Mary creeks and from previous studies at Calf Paddock. These new late Holocene slip rate estimates highlight the northeastward decrease in strike-slip and dip-slip rate along the northern section of the Alpine Fault as motion is partitioned onto faults of the Marlborough Fault System. The lack of aseismic creep observed across 'Evison's wall' highlights that slip is achieved at Calf Paddock during metre-scale coseismic displacements." ;

Yet, public audiences do not always receive research results in a passive and positive manner. Instead, as we discuss in this brief essay, research results can contested by multiple publics. At times, particularly in social media, the attacks can be swift. Research that is not intended to be a form of public sociology can inadvertently be brought into the public discourse. We discuss how interest groups, such as patient groups, can contest research results. Researchers can be personally attacked as well. These conflicts can create a turbulent environment where sociologists can lose control of their message. While most studies are released without incident, it is helpful to build the capacity of sociologists to participate in public sociology and manage challenges of their research results." ;

    schema:about "This article examines the production of China's \"ghost cities\" and constant urban expansion to challenge the dominant conceptual narrative of rural-to-urban migration as the driver of urbanisation. It argues that behind China's \"miraculous\" urbanisation story is a powerful ideological commitment to urban growth as the \"royal road\" to modernity and assessment of political performance. Local governments have a wide-ranging \"tool-kit\" for pursuing urbanisation, ranging from administrative border-drawing to expropriation of rural land and investment in expanding urban infrastructures. Urbanisation is the destination to which all paths seem to lead. Indeed, local states pursue the construction of new urban space, even when doing so harms them financially. But why? The concept of phantom urbanisation names the process whereby constructing the aesthetic form of the urban is even more important to local state actors than economic, demographic or environmental repercussions.

    schema:about "Drawing on a broad variety of field research projects among Salvadoran immigrant hometown associations in Los Angeles, conducted over a ten-year period, this paper seeks to contribute to the emerging literature on hometown associations by shifting the focus to the political processes underlying associational politics and the characteristics of the organizational field that structures their activities. We argue that conflict, both among migrants in the 'hostland' and between migrants in the hostland and stay-behinds in the 'homeland', is an inherent aspect of hometown association activities and their efforts to create sociability 'here' and development 'there'. We demonstrate that the hometowners abroad have difficulty deciding what they share in common; those who do engage in organized efforts to span here and there represent a select few. Moreover, the issue of how the migrants and their associations relate to the people and institutions left behind is often a dilemma, resolved in any number of ways, not all of which render satisfaction at either ends of the chain.

    schema:about "Academic librarians are challenged with development and maintenance of collections of research materials in various formats. Although it is assumed that they are monitoring the needs of their constituencies as a part of the collection management decision-making process, the literature reflects only a few studies that focus on direct solicitation of user opinions. This study included a 22-question survey sent to all faculty, staff, and graduate students in a cross-section of social science disciplines (anthropology, psychology, social work, and sociology) at one institution. Responses from 122 individuals (32.1% of faculty, 13.6% of graduate students, and 9.8% of staff) provide data about book and journal use that have informed collection development priorities and reveal shifting patterns of use in an increasingly hybrid (print and electronic) information environment. Results show that faculty and graduate students in all disciplines depend heavily on library collections and generally prefer to access materials online. When looking for books most respondents started from the library catalog, but those who indicated that the library was not important were more likely to search the Web and rely on colleagues to access materials, suggesting that social tagging might be an effective means of supporting resource discovery, especially if embedded in a scholarly community of practice. The relative importance of books and journals varies among (and within) disciplines and in accordance with the task at hand. Books are heavily used for teaching in all four disciplines, while journals are generally more important for research, especially among the more science-oriented specializations within anthropology and psychology. Even within these two disciplines, however, there are a number of scholars who rely heavily on books for research. Most respondents reported occasional use of interlibrary loan, more commonly for books than for journal articles, and this was generally considered to be an important and useful supplement to locally owned materials.

    schema:about "Building on previous models of collaboration processes, this article expands and revises the antecedent-process-outcome framework used to explain collaboration. The article discusses why this framework needs to be expanded to include the element of institutional structure. We propose a modified framework to explain collaboration that includes a typology of citizen-based, agency-based, and mixed partnerships. Furthermore, the article draws from the expansive body of literature on watershed collaboration to propose additional antecedents that influence institutional structures and, in turn, alter the process patterns in the collaboration \"black box.\" ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]; Copyright of International Journal of Public Administration is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

    schema:about "The article uses a self psychological lens to explore the notion of hysterical personality from our earliest understanding of it as the root of all psychogenic disorders, as discovered by Breuer and Freud, to its present elimination in the DSM-V. Can hysteria still be considered an applicable diagnosis or character style in the modern time? Or is it a culturally and historically limited phenomenon that no longer holds validity? Considering the case of Dora from Heinz Kohut's revolutionary view, which privileges the subjective and empathic stance in treatment, one can infer that Dora's own hysterical symptoms were not pathological, as Freud thought, but rather healthy attempts to bolster an enfeebled self. Nevertheless, both Kohut and his followers conclude that from a self psychological perspective both object-instinctual understandings, and self-object transferences, are essential for successful analytic treatment.

    schema:about "The article begins by analyzing the historical evolution of ?class ideology? in China, especially since 1978. Next, it turns to the concrete effects of the recent and ongoing recession on the Chinese working class. It finds that the crisis affected rural?urban migrants far more substantially than it did workers in the formal (mostly state-owned) urban sector. While this situation presents numerous challenges (for the central state, a crisis of legitimacy; for the local state, a crisis of managing social unrest as well as providing welfare; and, for the workers, a crisis of survival), it also creates opportunities for new conceptualizations and practices of class-politics. In conclusion, we discuss the nascent articulation of a few of these opportunities in labor-union activity, protests, and emergent rights-awareness, and legal consciousness among workers, as well as the implications for China's model of economic development.

    schema:about "Identifying suspect effort in neuropsychological assessments has been investigated in clinical samples and experimental simulation paradigms. While patients' incentives, such as compensation, are commonly thought to impact motivation, other motivational influences, such as attention-seeking, have been largely unexplored. To this end, undergraduates (n=202) were asked to fake a head injury on the Dot Counting Test, California Verbal Learning Test, and Benton Visual Retention Test. Participants were assigned to one of four Motivation conditions (no motivation, avoiding blame, compensation, attention-seeking). Analyses revealed that those with compensation- and attention-seeking motivations performed significantly worse than those with blame avoidance and no motivations, suggesting that type of motivation affects performance on neuropsychological assessment. The relative similarity between compensation-seekers and attention-seekers, however, suggests that the two groups would be difficult to differentiate. Preliminary findings suggest that compensation-seekers may favor errors of omission and attention-seekers may favor errors of commission in their performance; however this finding requires replication." ;

    schema:about "The questions of how to teach culture, which culture(s) to teach and how to lead students to intercultural competence and understanding are common questions for language teachers. The current project employed wikis to systematically integrate culture and authentic texts into beginning German courses at a large south-eastern university in the United States. The study examined whether close readings of authentic texts on a variety of cultural topics from German-speaking countries, careful discussion and then a final analysis of the topics in the form of students' essays could lead to a deeper understanding of the cultures of German-speaking countries and possibly of one's own culture. During this study, students were actively engaged in analysing authentic cultural documents to learn more about the products, practices and perspectives of the target culture, including how these three aspects interact and connect, thereby improving their analytical skills and thinking more critically about their own culture. As indicated by a pre-/post-test serving as quantitative data, students did increase their cultural knowledge of German-speaking countries, mainly in their knowledge of practices, over the semester. Qualitative analyses of their final essays indicated that students also expanded their awareness of perspectives of the target culture and gained a deeper understanding of their own culture.

    schema:about "Friedrich Holderlin's epistolary novel, Hyperion, opens with contradictory fantasies of the protagonist's unification with, and alienation from, nature. These visions of oneness and division find a corollary in the novel's setting within an idealized version of Greece and the landscape of the Corinthian Isthmus. The essay argues that we can best understand the significance of Hyperion's desire to be one with everything if we take into account the context of Holderlin's and Friedrich Schelling's attempt in the 1790s to find a way to incorporate a dynamic view of nature into German Idealist philosophy. Taking up the philosophical concept of intellectual intuition (used in distinctive ways by both Kant and Fichte before them) the young poet/philosophers attempted to grant a new range of meaning to the term. For them an intellectual form of intuition opens possibilities of non-material connections with a world of things that must themselves be viewed as dynamically alive. Reading the novel Hyperion as an attempt to poeticize this version of Idealism also allows us to see how the novel functions as a move from intellectual to aesthetic intuition, as an attempt to represent the human capacity for aesthetic creativity as our means of becoming one." ;

    schema:about "Communicators try to shape public opinion to their advantage by invoking social values. We examine a vivid example of this value framing in the debate over teaching evolution in the public schools. Supporters of intelligent design (ID) theory have pressed for greater acceptance in public schools by framing the issue as a question of fairness. A survey experiment revealed overwhelming agreement that including ID in science class is fairer than excluding it. This belief had a greater impact on tolerance for ID when the issue was framed with respect to fairness. A second study showed similar effects from a pro-ID documentary film. A final study showed that training in scientific reasoning counteracts the impact of the fairness value, thereby decreasing tolerance for ID. Combined, these studies show how political debate can be understood as a contest over which values deserve greatest consideration or emphasis." ;

Effectively accepting this traditional narrative, the 1990s prodemocracy movement pursued a broad social coalition to challenge authoritarian president Slobodan Milosevic.

With EU membership conditioned upon enforcement of a human rights regime that included sexual minorities, activists finally made strides toward legal protection and government recognition." ;

    schema:about "The imperative of climate justice has been gaining political and discursive power in international climate negotiations. Yet scholars are just beginning to investigate how climate policies are impacting social equity in practice. This paper contributes concrete examples and a multiscalar analysis to this emerging understanding. As cities are increasingly important players in global climate governance, it examines cases from three cities in the global North that have made notable attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a socially just way: Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, England; and Vancouver, British Columbia. These cases show that there is significant potential for cities to further global climate justice through emission reductions while enhancing social justice locally. However, they also demonstrate the importance of understanding just carbon mitigation as a multiscalar phenomenon. In each of these cities, leaders' abilities to mitigate climate change in a just way are shaped by larger processes of changing global markets, political opportunities and constraints, and inconsistent national regulatory environments. To the extent that cities continue to act as important sites of the carbon mitigation necessary to achieve global climate justice, this research highlights the necessity of creating national and global political conditions that enable the implementation of just climate mitigation in urban areas.

    schema:about "A group of Tunisian intellectuals, whom the author dubs 'the professors', has generated a body of thought that responds to the Islamist challenge and to the continuing authoritarianism of the Ben Ali government, which remains committed to secularist policies inherited from the Bourguiba era and to the propagation of an official version of Islam. The professors deny the possibility of unambiguous definition of the Arab-Islamic heritage, the turath, and oppose the use of any ideology derived from that notion. Denouncing Islam as ideology, they evoke the need for a liberal, democratic arena in which notions of truth and policy can be freely debated. They suggest the need for some separation of religion and politics, but they would oppose ideological secularism as much as they oppose any religious ideology. The future of this discourse, which is in a sense both post-modern and post-Islamist, remains uncertain.

    schema:about "How might military service members figure as perpetrators of human rights violations? The question remains a taboo, painful and suppressed topic in United States' face-to-face communities with strong veteran and active-duty presences. Our 2008-2014 ethnographic, team-based anthropological fieldwork focused on a mid-sized American city and its adjacent army base. We argue that the ambiguities and contradictions between soldiers-as-perpetrators and more common and public designations for soldiers and veterans - as heroes, protectors and volunteers, but also as victims of circumstance and injury - impede such exploration. War as a framework for legitimising lethal force complicates what constitutes perpetration, as do the implications of all-volunteer forces fighting protracted campaigns. The legacy of the Vietnam War brings key historicity to civilians' efforts to not repeat the a priori victimisation of veterans as presumed perpetrators, alongside recognition that the signature, psychological and moral injuries of the post-9/11 wars also can render veterans as victims in the public's perspective. Finally, as counterpoint to the generalised avoidance of confronting rights violations, we draw on a journalist's account of a veteran who sought to face an Iraqi victim who lost family members directly; their mutual victimhood is sharply qualified by the civilian's innocence and the veteran's willing volunteerism." ;

    schema:about "'Mild traumatic brain injury' (mTBI) and 'concussion' are terms often used interchangeably. However, 'mTBI' is frequently seen as representing a broader injury that encompasses the construct of 'concussion,' which often conveys transience or decreased severity. The present study examined the influence of varying diagnostic terminology on acute injury expectations in an undergraduate population (N = 105). Participants were presented with an mTBI vignette and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in which the term 'mTBI' or 'concussion' was used to describe the injury. There were no significant differences between the two conditions on anxiety, symptomatology, timeline, or consequence scales. However, participants in the 'mTBI' group allocated more days to return to play than participants in the 'concussion' group, suggesting that terminology has an effect on perceptions of the severity of the injury. Varsity athletes allocated fewer days to return to play than nonathletes. Individuals with a history of concussion, both athletes and nonathletes, indicated fewer days to return to play, but greater symptomatology than individuals with no history of concussion. Clinicians should consider the influence of diagnostic terminology, athletic background, and history of concussion on perceptions of the severity of an injury because expectations can influence injury outcomes and compliance in a recovery process.

    schema:about "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War (1846?1848) and was promoted as a way to extend the right of United States (U.S.) citizenship to Native, African, and Mexican Americans. In reality, the government reneged its responsibilities for federal protection of the rights of its new citizens, and constructed an empire that elevated Euro-Americans' social, economic, and class status, while diminishing the status of others. This article examines how the land grant adjudication process in postwar New Mexico formed a new political economy that adversely affected Mexicana property rights. As my primary source, I use testimonios from the Spanish Archives of New Mexico taken by the U.S. Surveyor General's Office from 1854?1890 to discuss how the testimonios are memories better categorised as an alternative historical archive within the officialised records. Thought of in this way, the testimonios counter traditional historical accounts that elide the importance of matrilineal links to the process of land acquisition in pre-American society, reveal the ambivalence of the land grant adjudication process, and serve as historical memories that reveal the position of Mexicanas as important actors in matters of property ownership, which in turn affected the way Mexicanos were represented within the space of the U.S. courtroom. Further, the testimonios reveal the complex relationship between marginalised and dispossessed Mexicana/o communities and the U.S. government.

    schema:about "This study examines the influence of experience with a second language (L2) on the perception of phonological contrasts in a third language (L3). This study contributes to L3 phonology by examining the influence of L2 phonological perception abilities on the perception of an L3 at the beginner level. Participants were native speakers of Korean whose L2 was English and whose L3 was Japanese. They participated in two perception tasks involving Japanese contrasts and one perception task involving English contrasts. Correlations between Korean participants' perception performance in their L2 and L3 were analysed to determine whether the level of L2 ability was related to the successful perception of phonological contrasts in the L3. The results of the correlation analysis demonstrate that, in general, the better the participants performed in their L2, the better they also performed in their L3, but this result was limited to a few contrasts. The overall findings suggest that L3 learners' phonological perception is positively influenced not only by experience with specific L2 contrasts, but also by the general experience of learning a foreign language, which gives them a global advantage in phonological perception." ;

    schema:about "Both Jung and Kohut place the notion of the discovery of “self” at the center of their psychological theories. Yet where Jung sees this process of discovery as possible only through connecting with the archetypes, which are at once immanent and transcendent, Kohut seemingly veers away from any notion of this in his thought. This article discusses the similarities and differences between Jungian and Kohutian ideas regarding dimensions of self to suggest that Kohut’s discovery of a mature self through cosmic narcissism is indeed touched with overtones of transcendence and spirituality. Raanan Kulka’s work on Buddhism also opens up Kohut’s thought to these dimensions, and greatly increases the possibilities for considering self psychology in spiritual and ethical terms. The term spiritual is used throughout this essay as a sense of participating in a supraordinate being that grants the self a sense of meaning not explicable through everyday experience.

    schema:about "Achieving and maintaining happiness can be difficult, especially when people are not engaging in the activities they know facilitate it. ?Flow? activities require clear rules, challenge, a high investment of energy, and have been shown to promote long-term happiness better than low investment, passive activities. Do people know this? In two studies, we found that, despite recognizing that flow activities are more likely to facilitate happiness, people nevertheless participated in passive leisure significantly more often in a typical week. Participants rated passive activities as being significantly more enjoyable, requiring less effort, and being less daunting to get started than flow activities. Participants? engagement in flow activities was significantly predicted by how enjoyable the activities were perceived to be, whereas how daunting those activities were rated predicted non-engagement. Passive activity engagement was only significantly predicted by enjoyment. Suggestions for enabling people to rise above the barriers to flow activities are offered.

    schema:about "While research on the spatial representation of number has provided substantial evidence for a horizontally oriented mental number line, recent studies suggest vertical organization as well. Directly comparing the relative strength of horizontal and vertical organization, however, we found no evidence of spontaneous vertical orientation (upward or downward), and horizontal trumped vertical when pitted against each other (Experiment 1). Only when numbers were conceptualized as magnitudes (as opposed to nonmagnitude ordinal sequences) did reliable vertical organization emerge, with upward orientation preferred (Experiment 2). Altogether, these findings suggest that horizontal representations predominate, and that vertical representations, when elicited, may be relatively inflexible. Implications for spatial organization beyond number, and its ontogenetic basis, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "This essay draws on correspondence between Smithsonian Institution curators and Edgar Alexander Mearns, an army surgeon who served in the Philippines during the first decade of the twentieth century, in order to explore ideas about loss in natural history collections. Beneath the appearance of abundance in these collections lies a constant concern with loss, not simply with the loss of specimens to spoil and slippage, but also with the loss of data and sometimes the loss of opportunities to acquire and describe new material. I explore the ways curators considered loss historically but also the ways that reconnecting natural history specimens and field books today offer possibilities for repairing some of these losses and more fully understanding the historical and cultural context of collection.

I, then, integrate the two papers by proposing, along with Coburn, that the ability to concomitantly \"own\" one's contextuality and individual freedom is the basis for a new concept of psychological maturity, and that Maduro's concepts of courageous knowing, emotional experiencing, and rigorous relationality are the keys to developing this innovative vision of psychological maturity." ;

    schema:about "Eighteenth-century Arabic manuscripts in the \"uncommon sciences\"-a range of mathematical, astronomical, astrological, medical, and divinatory practices number in the thousands. In light of the economic and social upheaval over the eighteenth century this sustained production must be understood from perspectives of both intellectual and social history. Ahmad al-Damanhuris writings and his rise from rural orphan to head of al-Azhar Mosque suggest the role and value of expertise in the uncommon sciences, particularly as these fields brought religious scholars and ruling military elites into close relations. Precisely because the uncommon sciences bridged these two social classes, this expertise was important for individuals' social and intellectual formation. Recognizing the significance of the uncommon sciences for the history of this period offers a new reading of the work of the chronicler 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, who used language and exemplars from the uncommon sciences to reflect on the proper and just relationship between expertise (embodied by the religious scholarly class) and the emerging state." ;

    schema:about "This study examined potential links among parents' role beliefs for involvement and social-contextual variables contributing to its development. A sample of parents from two Title I middle schools responded to surveys assessing their perceptions of student and teacher invitations to involvement, school expectations of involvement, school climate, childhood schooling experiences, and their role beliefs. Parents' perceptions of student invitations to involvement, school expectations of involvement, and school climate had the largest effects on parents' role beliefs in one school, while school climate was the sole predictor of parents' role beliefs in the other. Teachers' invitations to involvement were not directly related to role beliefs in either school. Differences between schools are discussed in relation to social and cultural capital." ;

    schema:about "Premise of research.The serpentine grassland system provides the opportunity to examine whether drought response traits may have contributed to differentiation in the stress-tolerant genus Clarkia. Commonly utilized drought responses might be indicative of traits important to species diversification in stressful environments. Methodology.We examined the drought response strategies of populations of Clarkia gracilis (Onagraceae) from both serpentine and nonserpentine soils. Physiological, morphological, and biomass data were collected under controlled greenhouse conditions. Pivotal results.Serpentine-derived plants exhibited faster growth and germination rates and larger leaf size than nonserpentine-derived plants under increasing water stress, indicating drought escape strategies. However, serpentine-derived plants also employed dehydration avoidance by increasing their water-use efficiency (decreased transpiration rate) under drought stress. In terms of biomass, serpentine-derived plants had a higher fitness potential than nonserpentine-derived plants. Nonserpentine-derived plants tended toward dehydration avoidance through decreased growth rate, decreased transpiration, and smaller leaf size. Conclusions.Our data support transpiration rate as a trait important to stress tolerance. Moreover, serpentine-derived plants avoid drought with drought escape strategies more than nonserpentine plants and may have a higher fitness potential, particularly in water-limiting conditions. Thus, serpentine populations may be competitively superior to nonserpentine populations under drought stress conditions." ;

The accuracy of relative proper motions for well-measured stars ranges from similar to 0.2 mas yr(-1) within 10' of the cluster center to 1.1 mas yr(-1) outside this radius. In the proper motion vector-point diagram, the separation between the cluster members and field stars is convincing down to V similar to 18 and within 10' from the cluster center. The formal sum of membership probabilities indicates a total of similar to 2500 cluster members down to V similar to 22. We confirm the cluster membership of several variable stars, including some eclipsing binaries. The estimated absolute proper motion of NGC 6819 is mu(abs)(x) = -2.6 +/- 0.5 and mu(abs)(y) = -4.2 +/- 0.5 mas yr(-1). A cross-identification between the proper motion catalog and a list of X-ray sources in the field of NGC 6819 resulted in a number of new likely optical counterparts, including a candidate CV. For the first time we show that there is significant differential reddening toward NGC 6819." ;

Within a 1 degrees field of view, our stellar sample includes the giant branch, the red clump, and blue straggler candidates, and extends to almost 2 mag below the main sequence (MS) turnoff. For each star observed in our survey we present all RV measurements, the average RV, and velocity variability information. Additionally, we discuss notable binaries from our sample, including eclipsing binaries (WOCS 23009, WOCS 24009, and WOCS 40007), stars noted in Kepler asteroseismology studies (WOCS 4008, WOCS 7009, and WOCS 8007), and potential descendants of past blue stragglers (WOCS 1006 and WOCS 6002).

As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we present precise (sigma = 0.38 km s(-1)) radial velocities for proper motion candidate members of NGC 6791 from Platais et al. Our survey, extending down to g' similar to 16.8, is comprised of the evolved cluster population, including blue stragglers, giants, and horizontal branch stars. Of the 280 proper-motion-selected stars above our magnitude limit, 93% have at least one radial velocity measurement and 79% have three measurements over the course of at least 200 days, sufficient for secure radial-velocity-determined membership of non-velocity-variable stars. The Platais et al. proper motion catalog includes 12 anomalous horizontal branch candidates blueward of the red clump, of which we find only 4 to be cluster members. Three fall slightly blueward of the red clump and the fourth is consistent with being a blue straggler. The cleaned color-magnitude diagram shows a richly populated red giant branch and a blue straggler population. Half of the blue stragglers are in binaries. From our radial velocity measurement distribution, we find the cluster's radial velocity dispersion to be sigma(c) = 0.62 +/- 0.10 km s(-1). This corresponds to a dynamical mass of similar to 4600M(circle dot)." ;

    schema:about "The young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 (NGC 2168) has been one of the core clusters of the WIYN Open Cluster Study since 1997. Over these 17 years we have obtained approximately 8000 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of stars in the M35 field, which we provide here. Our target sample consists of 1355 photometrically selected stars in the field of M35 within the main sequence and binary sequence of the cluster and within 13 = 0.6. Using our RV measurements we cleanly separate likely cluster members from field stars. We calculate RV membership probabilities for over 1200 stars in our sample. 418 are probable cluster members, of which 64 are velocity-variable (binary) systems. Here we present 52 orbital solutions for binary members of M35. This sample defines the hard binary population of M35 that dynamically powers the cluster. We also present XMM-Newton X-ray detections within the cluster. We use our large binary sample to search for interacting binaries among the X-ray sources, investigate M35's period-eccentricity distribution, and determine binary frequency. We find a circularization period of 9.9 +/- 1.2 days and a binary frequency of 24% +/- 3% for main-sequence binaries with P < 10(4) days. Determining these properties in a young cluster like M35 is key to defining the initial conditions used in models of cluster dynamical evolution." ;

In the past decade, Chandra X-ray observations have shown a relationship between the X-ray population of globular clusters and their internal dynamics and encounter frequency. We investigate the role dynamics possibly play in the formation of X-ray sources in NGC 6819, and compare our results with known properties of field and globular cluster X-ray populations. We implement a multi-wavelength approach to studying the X-ray sources, utilizing X-ray and UV data from XMM observations along with the wealth of photometry and radial-velocity data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study and the CFHT Open Cluster Survey. Within the cluster half-light radius, we detect 12 X-ray sources down to a luminosity of 10(30) erg s(-1) for cluster members. The sources include a candidate quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (qLMXB), a candidate cataclysmic variable, and two active binary systems. The presence of a qLMXB in an open cluster is previously unexpected given the known relationships between luminous X-ray sources and encounter frequency in globular clusters, and most likely has a dynamical origin." ;

    schema:about "We present results of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey searching for white dwarf (WD) companions to blue straggler stars (BSSs) in open cluster NGC 188. The majority of NGC 188 BSSs (15 of 21) are single-lined binaries with properties suggestive of mass-transfer formation via Roche lobe overflow, specifically through an asymptotic giant branch star transferring mass to a main sequence secondary, yielding a BSS binary with a WD companion. In NGC 188, a BSS formed by this mechanism within the past 400 Myr will have a WD companion that is hot and luminous enough to be directly detected as a FUV photometric excess with HST. Comparing expected BSS FUV emission to observed photometry reveals four BSSs with WD companions above 12,000 K (younger than 250 Myr) and three WD companions with temperatures between 11,000 and 12,000 K. These BSS+WD binaries all formed through recent mass transfer. The location of the young BSSs in an optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) indicates that distance from the zero-age main sequence does not necessarily correlate with BSS age. There is no clear CMD separation between mass transfer-formed BSSs and those likely formed through other mechanisms, such as collisions. The seven detected WD companions place a lower limit on the mass-transfer formation frequency of 33%. We consider other possible formation mechanisms by comparing properties of the BSS population to theoretical predictions. We conclude that 14 BSS binaries likely formed from mass transfer, resulting in an inferred mass-transfer formation frequency of approximately 67%." ;

    schema:about "Measurement of atomic force microscope cantilever spring constants (k) is essential for many of the applications of this versatile instrument. Numerous techniques to measure k have been proposed. Among these, we found the thermal noise and Sader methods to be commonly applicable and relatively user-friendly, providing an in situ, non-destructive, fast measurement of k for a cantilever independent of its material or coating. Such advantages recommend these methods for widespread use. An impediment thereto is the significant complication involved in the initial implementation of the methods. Some details of the implementation are discussed in publications, while others are left unsaid. Here we present a complete, cohesive, and practically oriented discussion of the implementation of both the thermal noise and Sader methods of measuring cantilever spring constants. We review the relevant theory and discuss practical experimental means for determining the required quantities. We then present results that compare measurements of k by these two methods over nearly two orders of magnitude, and we discuss the likely origins of both statistical and systematic errors for both methods. In conclusion, we find that the two methods agree to within an average of 4% over the wide range of cantilevers measured. Given that the methods derive from distinct physics we find the agreement a compelling argument in favour of the accuracy of both, suggesting them as practical standards for the field." ;

These companions are direct and secure observational evidence that these blue straggler stars were formed through mass transfer in binary stars.

    schema:about "Background and Aims Species of Araceae accumulate calcium oxalate in the form of characteristically grooved needle-shaped raphide crystals and multi-crystal druses. This study focuses on the distribution and development of raphides and druses during leaf growth in ten species of Amorphophallus (Araceae) in order to determine the crystal macropatterns and the underlying ultrastructural features associated with formation of the unusual raphide groove. Methods Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and both bright-field and polarized-light microscopy were used to study a range of developmental stages. Key Results Raphide crystals are initiated very early in plant development. They are consistently present in most species and have a fairly uniform distribution within mature tissues. Individual raphides may be formed by calcium oxalate deposition within individual crystal chambers in the vacuole of an idioblast. Druse crystals form later in the true leaves, and are absent from some species. Distribution of druses within leaves is more variable. Druses initially develop at leaf tips and then increase basipetally as the leaf ages. Druse development may also be initiated in crystal chambers. Conclusions The unusual grooved raphides in Amorphophallus species probably result from an unusual crystal chamber morphology. There are multiple systems of transport and biomineralization of calcium into the vacuole of the idioblast. Differences between raphide and druse idioblasts indicate different levels of cellular regulation. The relatively early development of raphides provides a defensive function in soft, growing tissues, and restricts build-up of dangerously high levels of calcium in tissues that lack the ability to adequately regulate calcium. The later development of druses could be primarily for calcium sequestration." ;

    schema:about "Neuropsychological baseline testing is commonplace in the assessment of concussion; however, claims of sandbagging the baseline have led neuropsychologists to ask to what extent athletes can perform intentionally poorly on baseline testing without reaching threshold on the test validity indicators. Seventy-five undergraduate athletes were re-administered the ImPACT neurocognitive battery, which they had previously taken to establish baseline functioning, but were instructed to perform more poorly than their baseline without reaching threshold on the test validity indicators. Eight participants were able to successfully fake significantly lower scores without detection by validity indicators. Concussion history was not related to performance. Successful fakers did not perform significantly worse on the Reaction Time Composite and Three Letters Total Letters Correct, questioning the utility of these measures for detecting sandbagging. Successful fakers reported using less purposeful faking strategies which naturally facilitated errors. The data suggest that sandbagging the baseline, even under conditions involving motivation, instruction, and experience with the test, is difficult to accomplish without being detected." ;

Understanding the causes of this decline could offer important insight into designing effective policies to continue this trend. This article uses the Area-Identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), the same data used to generate the DOJ's national estimates, merged with county-level variables, to examine the determinants of women reporting abuse. The results indicate that there are three important factors that likely contribute to the decline: (1) the increased provision of legal services for victims of intimate partner abuse, (2) improvements in women's economic status, and (3) demographic trends, most notably the aging of the population.

    schema:about "The present study explored differences in dendritic/spine extent across several human cortical regions. Specifically, the basilar dendrites/spines of supragranular pyramidal cells were examined in eight Brodmann's areas (BA) arranged according to Benson's functional hierarchy: primary cortex (somatosensory, BA3-1-2; motor, BA4), unimodal cortex (Wernicke's area, BA22: Broca's area, BA44), heteromodal cortex (supplementary motor area, BA6 beta; angular gyrus, BA39) and supramodal cortex (superior frontopolar zone, BA10; inferior frontopolar zone, BA11), To capture more general aspects of regional variability, primary and unimodal areas were designated as low integrative regions: heteromodal and supramodal areas were designated as high integrative regions. Tissue was obtained from the left hemisphere of 10 neurologically normal individuals (M(ago) = 30 +/- 17 years; five males, five females) and stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Ten neurons were sampled from each cortical region (n = 800) and evaluated according to total dendritic length, mean segment length, dendritic segment count, dendritic spine number and dendritic spine density. Despite considerable inter-individual variation, there were significant differences across the eight Brodmann's areas and between the high and low integrative regions for all dendritic and spine measures. Dendritic systems in primary and unimodal regions were consistently less complex than in heteromodal and supramodal areas. The range within these rankings was substantial, with total dendritic length in BA10 being 31% greater than that in BA3-1-2, and dendritic spins number being 69% greater. These findings demonstrate that cortical regions involved in the early stages of processing (e.g. primary sensory areas) generally exhibit less complex dendritic/spine systems than those regions involved in the later stages of information processing (e.g, prefrontal cortex). This dendritic progression appears to reflect significant differences in the nature of cortical processing, with spine-dense neurons at hierarchically higher association levels integrating a broader range of synaptic input than those at lower cortical levels." ;

    schema:about "Although the primate insular cortex has been studied extensively, a comprehensive investigation of its neuronal morphology has yet to be completed. To that end, neurons from 20 human subjects (10 males and 10 females; N = 600) were selected from the secondary gyrus brevis, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus of the left insula. The secondary gyrus brevis was generally more complex in terms of dendritic/spine extent than either the precentral or postcentral insular gyri, which is consistent with the posterior-anterior gradient of dendritic complexity observed in other cortical regions. The male insula had longer, spinier dendrites than the female insula, potentially reflecting sex differences in interoception. In comparing the current insular data with regional dendritic data quantified from other Brodmann's areas (BAs), insular total dendritic length (TDL) was less than the TDL of high integration cortices (BA6 beta, 10, 11, 39), but greater than the TDL of low integration cortices (BA3-1-2, 4, 22, 44). Insular dendritic spine number was significantly greater than both low and high integration regions. Overall, the insula had spinier, but shorter neurons than did high integration cortices, and thus may represent a specialized type of heteromodal cortex, one that integrates crude multisensory information crucial to interoceptive processes." ;

Although there are several investigations in humans and other primates, virtually nothing is known about regional variation in the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex of great apes, humans' closest living relatives. The current study uses the rapid Golgi stain to quantify the dendritic structure of layer III pyramidal neurons in 4 areas of the chimpanzee cerebral cortex: Primary somatosensory (area 3b), primary motor (area 4), prestriate visual (area 18), and prefrontal (area 10) cortex. Consistent with previous studies in humans and macaque monkeys, pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of chimpanzees exhibit greater dendritic complexity than those in other cortical regions, suggesting that prefrontal cortical evolution in primates is characterized by increased potential for integrative connectivity. Compared with chimpanzees, the pyramidal neurons of humans had significantly longer and more branched dendritic arbors in all cortical regions." ;

    schema:about "Centromere organization has evolved dramatically in one clade of fungi, the Saccharomycotina. These yeasts have lost the ability to make normal eukaryotic heterochromatin with histone H3K9 methylation, which is a major component of pericentromeric regions in other eukaryotes. Following this loss, several different types of centromere emerged, including two types of sequence-defined (\"point\") centromeres, and the epigenetically defined \"small regional\" centromeres of Candida albicans. Here we report that centromeres of the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) are structurally defined. Each of its four centromeres consists of a 2-kb inverted repeat (IR) flanking a 1-kb central core (mid) region. The four centromeres are unrelated in sequence. CenH3 (Cse4) binds strongly to the cores, with a decreasing gradient along the IRs. Thismode of organization resembles Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres but is much more compact and lacks the extensive flanking heterochromatic otr repeats. Different isolates of K. phaffii show polymorphism for the orientation of the mid regions, due to recombination in the IRs. CEN4 is located within a 138-kb region that changes orientation duringmating-type switching, but switching does not induce recombination of centromeric IRs. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary transitions in centromere organization have occurred inmultiple yeast clades.

    schema:about "Gap repair is a technique that has historically been used to clone entire operons by using the natural recombinant homologous cloning mechanism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using S. cerevisiae in vivo recombination, we can manipulate and express operons from different Vibrio fischeri strains from geographically distinct squid host populations to determine if suites of genes are responsible for the specificity observed among closely related host-symbiont pairs. V. fischeri ES114 genomic DNA (isolated from Euprymna scolopes, a Hawaiian squid host) was then used as the nucleotide template; the targeted operon and the gapped vector was digested and simultaneously introduced into yeast cells allowing recombination. V. fischeri  can then be transformed with the new vector by tri-parental mating to contain entire operons/regulons from the other strain, in this case  V. fischeri  ETJB1H (isolated from  E. tasmanica, an Australian squid host). This technique allowed us to execute a detailed investigation of the importance in strain-specificity of these gene operons in vivo. Subsequently, two different squid host species (E. scolopes and E. tasmanica) were used to test colonization abilities and competition of the constructed strains. Results indicate that after mobilizing lux and pil operons from ETJB1H to ES114, colonization of the constructed strain was equivalent to the efficiency observed for the native strain; the same was observed for the  msh operon, but in this case after mobilization from ES114 to ETJB1H. Thus, competitive ability based on symbiotic loci is not equal among closely related strains of Vibrio. Deciphering how the evolutionary history of specificity between closely related Vibrio strains occurred may give insight to the function of competence and inter-strain genetic specificity." ;

    schema:about "Students who have lived a winter in Utah are familiar through first hand experience with the fact that temperature inversions trap pollution. And temperature gradients in lakes are also familiar to outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy a summer swim or fishing trip, but are they aware of how climate change may influence lake ecology? Even less familiar is how to model or study such systems mathematically. As part of our undergraduate curriculum development project: Laboratory Experiences in Mathematical Biology, we have developed a lab that introduces students quantitatively to atmospheric temperature inversions, and basic limnology while addressing mathematical topics from multivariable calculus. In this laboratory, students work in groups to gather temperature data from a glass in which a fixed volume of cool milk is inserted beneath an approximately equal volume of hot coffee. The purpose of the lab is to give students a hands on experience with a function of two independent variables (time and space), expose them to the challenges of making mathematical models of real life phenomena including the process of discretizing continuous variables and making measurements, as well as to introduce/strengthen student experience with the following mathematical technical notions: functions of two variables, graphs of surfaces, contour maps of surfaces, level curves, limits of multivariable functions, and partial derivatives. In the presentation, I will share the results of our trials of this lab with students, as well as the current state of our resources for implementing the lab." ;

    schema:about "Anatectic granites from the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex yield U-Pb zircon crystallization ages that range from 115 to 100Ma, with a dominant grouping at 107-100 Ma, which corresponds to the timing of dome formation during the regional oblique extension that facilitated exhumation of the complex. The occurrence of leucosome-bearing normal-sense shear zones inmigmatitic gneisses indicates that suprasolidus conditions in the crust continued into the early stages of doming and exhumation of the complex. The structure allows access to variably oriented granites in networks of dykes at deeper structural levels and subhorizontal sheeted granites at shallower structural levels within the complex. This feature allows an evaluation of the mechanisms that modify the composition of granite melts in their source and of granite magmas during their ascent and emplacement using whole-rock major, trace element and Sr and Nd isotope compositions, zircon Hf and O isotope compositions, and phase equilibria modelling of potential source rocks. Geochemical variability within the granites is attributed to source heterogeneity and blending of melts, which themselves are consistent with derivation from regional metasedimentary and metaplutonic source materials. The granites typically contain coarse blocky K-feldspar and/or plagioclase grains within interstitial quartz, and have low Rb/Sr ratios and large positive Eu anomalies. These features are inconsistent with the composition of primary crustal melts derived from metasedimentary and metaplutonic source materials, but consistent with early fractional crystallization of feldspar and subsequent drainage of the fractionated melt. Processes such as peritectic mineral entrainment and accessory mineral dissolution, entrainment and crystallization did not have any significant influence on the major and trace element composition of the granites. The granites in the networks of dykes are interpreted to represent choking of magma transport channels through the middle crust as the rate of magma flow declined during doming and exhumation, whereas the sheeted granites record collapse of subhorizontal, partially crystallized layers of magma by filter pressing and melt exfiltration during vertical shortening associated with doming and exhumation. These processes separated feldspar-rich residues from evolved melt. Based on the results of this study, caution is urged in estimating melt proportion from the volume of granite retained in migmatitic gneiss domes, as the granites may not represent liquid compositions." ;

    schema:about "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), chemicals commonly used as flame retardants, are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife. However, little is known about their potential toxicological properties. In the present study, male Long-Evans rats orally administered the commercial PBDE mixture DE-71 or corn oil for 1 week, beginning at postnatal day (PND) 6, were tested on a visual discrimination task and two sustained attention tasks. After completion of these tasks, the rats were administered a drug challenge with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 mg/kg), which was injected subcutaneously 30 min prior to testing on the second sustained attention task. The DE-71-exposed rats demonstrated deficits in learning but not in sustained attention when compared to controls. Scopolamine impaired the animals' ability to detect the brief visual cues in controls, as evidenced by decreases in accuracy and increases in omission errors. However, the DE-71-exposed rats were subsensitive to the effects of scopolamine on omission errors, particularly on trials in which a long delay preceded the cue, suggesting alterations in the cholinergic modulation of sustained attention. For the DE-71-exposed rats, the lack of sustained attention deficits in the absence of the drug, coupled with the subsensitivity to scopolamine's effects on sustained attention, suggest that although this PBDE mixture produced lasting alterations in cholinergic functioning, either (1) these alterations were not of sufficient magnitude to be behaviorally relevant, or (2) behavioral deficits resulting from these alterations were overcome by the development of compensatory neural mechanisms or response strategies in adulthood." ;

    schema:about "The latest Neoproterozoic extinction of the Ediacara biota has been variously attributed to catastrophic removal by perturbations to global geochemical cycles, 'biotic replacement' by Cambrian-type ecosystem engineers, and a taphonomic artefact. We perform the first critical test of the 'biotic replacement' hypothesis using combined palaeoecological and geochemical data collected from the youngest aliacaran strata in southern Namibia. We find that, even after accounting for a variety of potential sampling and taphonomic biases, the Ediacaran assemblage preserved at Farm Swartpunt has significantly lower genus richness than older assemblages. Geochemical and sedimentological analyses confirm an oxygenated and non-restricted palaeoenvironment for fossil-bearing sediments, thus suggesting that oxygen stress and/or hypersalinity are unlikely to be responsible for the low diversity of communities preserved at Swartpunt. These combined analyses suggest depauperate communities characterized the latest Ediacaran and provide the first quantitative support for the biotic replacement model for the end of the Ecliacara biota. Although more sites (especially those recording different palaeoenvironments) are undoubtedly needed, this study provides the first quantitative palaeoecological evidence to suggest that evolutionary innovation, ecosystem engineering and biological interactions may have ultimately caused the first mass extinction of complex life." ;

    schema:about "Interhemispheric communication may be constrained as brain size increases because of transmission delays in action potentials over the length of axons. Although one might expect larger brains to have progressively thicker axons to compensate, spatial packing is a limiting factor. Axon size distributions within the primate corpus callosum (CC) may provide insights into how these demands affect conduction velocity. We used electron microscopy to explore phylogenetic variation in myelinated axon density and diameter of the CC from 14 different anthropoid primate species, including humans. The majority of axons were less than 1 mm in diameter across all species, indicating that conduction velocity for most interhemispheric communication is relatively constant regardless of brain size. The largest axons within the upper 95th percentile scaled with a progressively higher exponent than the median axons towards the posterior region of the CC. While brain mass among the primates in our analysis varied by 97-fold, estimates of the fastest cross-brain conduction times, as conveyed by axons at the 95th percentile, varied within a relatively narrow range between 3 and 9 ms across species, whereas cross-brain conduction times for the median axon diameters differed more substantially between 11 and 38 ms. Nonetheless, for both size classes of axons, an increase in diameter does not entirely compensate for the delay in interhemispheric transmission time that accompanies larger brain size. Such biophysical constraints on the processing speed of axons conveyed by the CC may play an important role in the evolution of hemispheric asymmetry." ;

NFRs associated with transcription initiation sites as well as those not associated with promoters are affected. We dissected the roles of the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and the HP1 proteins Swi6 and Chp2, as well as the two catalytic activities of the SHREC histone deacetylase (HDAC)/ATPase effector complex. Strikingly, different DNA sites have distinct combinatorial requirements for these factors: Five classes of NFRs were identified that are eliminated by silencing factors through a mechanistic hierarchy governed by Clr4. The SHREC HDAC activity plays a major role in the elimination of class I-IV NFRs by antagonizing the action of RSC, a remodeling complex implicated in NFR formation. We propose that heterochromatin formation involves the deployment in several sequence-specific mechanisms to eliminate gaps between nucleosomes, thereby blocking access to the DNA." ;

At all dopings, the low energy density-of-states modulations are analyzed according to a simple model of quasiparticle interference and found to be consistent with Fermi-arc superconductivity. The superconducting coherence peaks, ubiquitous in near-optimal tunneling spectra, are destroyed with strong underdoping and a new spectral type appears. Exclusively in regions exhibiting this new spectrum, we find local \"checkerboard\" charge ordering of high energy states, with a wave vector of (Q) over right arrow=(+/- 2 pi/4.5a(0),0); (0,+/- 2 pi/4.5a(0))+/- 15%. Surprisingly, this spatial ordering of high energy states coexists harmoniously with the low energy Bogoliubov quasiparticle states." ;

    schema:about "The Lower Ordovician Shirgesht Formation in central Iran is composed of siliciclastic and carbonate rocks deposited in diverse coastal and marine shelfal environments (tidal flat, lagoon, shoreface, offshore-shelf and carbonate ramp). Five fades associations contain diverse ichnofossil assemblages that show distinct proximal to distal trends formed in a wide range of physical-chemical conditions. The ethological groups of trace fossils in the Shirgesht Formation reflect a gradient of depositional stress conditions across a wave-influenced shoreline and shelf. Deposits of wave influenced environments make up a significant component of the geological record of shallow marine settings, and the ability to determine paleoenvironments in detail in such successions is critical for reconstruction of depositional histories and sequence-stratigraphic interpretation. The Cruziana ichnofacies of the study shows highly diverse suites that record the establishment of a benthic community under stable conditions and a long-term colonization window. The Skolithos ichnofacies recognized is a low diversity opportunistic ichnocommunity suite that resulted from colonization after tempestite deposition in a stressed environment. The strata record an onshore to offshore replacement of the Cruziana ichnofacies (with abundant feeding traces of deposit-feeders) by the Skolithos ichnofacies (dominated by suspension-feeders and predators). A transitional zone between the two ichnofacies coincides with the offshore-transition/distal lower-surface deposits. The distribution of ichnofacies, the diversity and range of ethological characteristics reflected by the ichnogenera, and the wide range of wave-dominated coastal facies demonstrate the potential to use individual trace fossils and ichnofacies for significantly refined palaeoenvironmental analysis of wave dominated coastal settings, particularly in Ordovician successions." ;

    schema:about "Previous scholarship has demonstrated that female lawmakers differ from their male counterparts by engaging more fully in consensus-building activities. We argue that this behavioral difference does not serve women equally well in all institutional settings. Contentious and partisan activities of male lawmakers may help them outperform women when in a polarized majority party. However, in the minority party, while men may choose to obstruct and delay, women continue to strive to build coalitions and bring about new policies. We find strong evidence that minority party women in the U.S. House of Representatives are better able to keep their sponsored bills alive through later stages of the legislative process than are minority party men, across the 93rd110th Congresses (19732008). The opposite is true for majority party women, however, who counterbalance this lack of later success by introducing more legislation. Moreover, while the legislative style of minority party women has served them well consistently across the past four decades, majority party women have become less effective as Congress has become more polarized." ;

    schema:about "Categories can affect our perception of the world, rendering between-category differences more salient than within-category ones. Across many studies, such categorical perception (CP) has been observed for the basic-level categories of one's native language. Other research points to categorical distinctions beyond the basic level, but it does not demonstrate CP for such distinctions. Here we provide such a demonstration. Specifically, we show CP in English speakers for the non-basic distinction between 'warm' and 'cool' colors, claimed to represent the earliest stage of color lexicon evolution. Notably, the advantage for discriminating colors that straddle the warm-cool boundary was restricted to the right visual field, the same behavioral signature previously observed for basic-level categories. This pattern held in a replication experiment with increased power. Our findings show that categorical distinctions beyond the basic-level repertoire of one's native language are psychologically salient and may be spontaneously accessed during normal perceptual processing.

    schema:about "Sex determines much about one's life, but what determines one's sex? The answer is complicated and incomplete: on close examination, ordinary notions of female and male are vague. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee further specified what they mean by woman in response to questions about who, exactly, is eligible to compete in women's Olympic events. I argue, first, that their stipulation is evidence that the use of vague terms is better described by semantic approaches to vagueness than by epistemic approaches. In addition, the IOC's 2012 stipulation was made with sensitivity to its practical consequences. Linguistic actions often have morally relevant consequences, and I contend that, other things equal, we should adopt theories about language that acknowledge the responsibility we bear for what we say. Taking vagueness to be an epistemic phenomenon precludes the sense of agency needed for moral responsibility; taking it to be semantic does not. Thus I advance two arguments for semantic approaches to vagueness, as against epistemic approaches: one descriptive and one normative." ;

    schema:about "Puya (Bromeliaceae), with >?200 species, is a classic example of a recent, rapid species-level radiation in the Andes. To assess the biogeographical history of this primarily Andean species group and the evolution of different life histories, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data were generated for 75 species from throughout the geographical range of the genus. Distribution data for latitudinal and elevational ranges were compiled for almost all species. The greatest number of species is found at mid-elevations and mid-latitudes south of the equator. The genus originated in central Chile and first moved into the Cordillera Oriental of the central Andes via inter-Andean valleys. Cladogenesis progressed in a general south to north direction tracking the final uplift of the Andes. All taxa north of the Western Andean Portal form a monophyletic group implying a single colonization of the northern Andes, with no subsequent transitions back south from the Northern Andes. Repeated evolutionary transitions of lineages up and down in elevation are suggestive of allopatric speciation driven by Pleistocene glaciation cycles. True semelparity evolved once in P.?raimondii, with similar semi-semelparity evolving repeatedly in paramos of the northern Andes. Fieldwork and phylogenetic characterization of high-elevation Puya are priorities for future efforts.

Abstract: De novo malignancies represent an increasing concern in the transplant population, particularly as long-term graft and patient survival improves. EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma in the setting of PTLD is the leading malignancy in children following solid organ transplantation. Therapeutic strategies can be categorized as pharmacologic, biologic, and cell-based but the variable efficacy of these approaches and the complexity of PTLD suggest that new treatment options are warranted. Here, we review current therapeutic strategies for treatment of PTLD. We also describe the life cycle of EBV, addressing the viral mechanisms that contribute to the genesis and persistence of EBV+ B-cell lymphomas. Specifically, we focus on the oncogenic signaling pathways activated by the EBV LMP1 and LMP2a to understand the underlying mechanisms and mediators of lymphomagenesis with the goal of identifying novel, rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.

    schema:about "Using US cross-sectional data, this paper calculates the welfare cost of a 10 percent inflation for different individuals and finds that the difference in cost between the poorest 20 percent, measured by their net worth, and the richest 20 percent is in the order of 102 percent. That is, a poor person is on average willing to forgive 102 percent more of their total consumption in order to have inflation reduced from 10 percent to 0. In absolute terms this represents a cost of 0.461 percent of consumption for the poorest and 0.228 percent for the richest. I accomplish this by introducing preference heterogeneity in a monetary search model first developed by Lagos and Wright, and calibrate the model to match each agent's type of cash holdings, approximated by their holdings in transactional accounts that bear almost no interest, as a fraction of their net worth using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. I also show that this welfare difference increases to 130 percent (2.28 percent for the poorest 20 percent and 0.992 percent for the richest 20 percent) whenever frictions in the use of money are imposed (holdup problem). This distributional effect is further augmented if more frictions in the terms of trade are present. The ability to explicitly model these frictions is the advantage of using this model. Hence, inflation in this framework, as other studies have shown, acts as a regressive consumption tax; and this regressiveness is augmented with the holdup problem." ;

Output is found to be below a no-AIDS output in a range between 3% (10%), when only unskilled workers are affected, and 10% (28%), when only skilled workers are affected, whenever the overall infection rate is 7% (20%). When investigating the hypothesis that AIDS affects skilled workers more severely than unskilled at the beginning of the epidemic, with the effect switching as the epidemic becomes more mature, the findings are that the economy can be 8% smaller along the transition path. In all scenarios where the epidemic is temporary, it would take four to five generations or about 90 years for sub-Saharan Africa to recover." ;

In Experience and Its Modes (1933) he analyzed science as a distinctive \"mode,\" or account of experience as a whole, identifying those assumptions necessary for science to achieve its coherent account of experience in contrast to other modes of experience whose quests for coherence depend on different assumptions. Religious experience, he thought, was integral to the practical mode. The latter experiences the world as interminable tension between what is and what ought to be. The question, Is there a conflict between science and religion ? is, in Oakeshott's approach, the question, Is there a conflict between the scientific mode of experience and the practical mode ? Insofar as we tend to treat every question as a practical one, these questions seem to make sense. But Oakeshott's analysis leads to the view that scientific experience and religious experience are categorically different accounts of experience abstracted from the whole of experience. They are voices of experience that may speak to each other, but they are not ordered hierarchically. Nor can either absorb the other without insoluble contradictions." ;

(2) Biological stoichiometry drives changes in mineral stoichiometry and distribution through weathering. (3) On landscapes experiencing little erosion, biology drives weathering during initial succession, whereas weathering drives biology over the long term.(4) In eroding landscapes, weathering-front advance at depth is coupled to surface denudation via biotic processes.(5) Biology shapes the topography of the Critical Zone.(6) The impact of climate forcing on denudation rates in natural systems can be predicted from models incorporating biogeochemical reaction rates and geomorphological transport laws.(7) Rising global temperatures will increase carbon losses from the Critical Zone.(8) Rising atmospheric P-CO2 will increase rates and extents of mineral weathering in soils.(9) Riverine solute fluxes will respond to changes in climate primarily due to changes in water fluxes and secondarily through changes in biologically mediated weathering.(10) Land use change will impact Critical Zone processes and exports more than climate change.

    schema:about "Precipitation patterns during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Rocky Mountains varied due to the influence of the continental ice sheets and pluvial lakes. However, no constraints have been placed on potential changes of southeasterly Gulf of Mexico-derived moisture that today contributes considerable precipitation to the easternmost ranges of the southern and middle Rocky Mountains. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains of southern Colorado are ideally situated to assess the relative importance of westerly and southeasterly-derived moisture during the LGM. Based on reconstructions of 30 palaeoglaciers in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, we find that LGM equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) on the east side of the range were systematically 100-200 m lower than ELAs on the west side. The observed ELA pattern is strikingly similar to modern precipitation patterns in the study area, suggesting that southeasterly-derived precipitation had a significant influence on the mass balances of LGM glaciers." ;

    schema:about "Despite the prevalence of intimate partner violence and its social costs, we show that many counties lack services to help victims and that community resources play a significant role in determining the likelihood of service provision. Because resources are often generated at the local level and state and federal funding usually require a grant proposal, services for victims of intimate partner violence are more likely to be available in well-resourced areas with a major college or university in the county. Analysis of the changes in the provision of services since the Violence Against Women Act was introduced suggests that funding needs to be specifically targeted to underserved areas.

In particular, we consider Canadian legislation and the use of compulsory licensing for HIV/AIDS drugs destined for a developing country. This is then contrasted with the conditions under which Thai authorities are pursuing compulsory licenses, the outcomes of their compulsory licenses, as well as the likely impact of the Thai policy. Finally, we construct a rubric to evaluate characteristics of a successful regime. This is used to analyze the Canadian and Thai regimes and frame the expected implications of each national policy. It is hoped that the assessment will guide changes to compulsory licensing design to ensure that legitimate regimes are embraced while illegitimate ones are disallowed." ;

In particular, recent studies have shown substantial morphological diversity among spiny projecting neurons in species that diverged close to the base of the mammalian radiation (e.g., monotremes, afrotherians, and xenarthrans). Here, we used a Golgi technique to examine different neuronal morphologies in an afrotherian species, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis), and provide a comparison with the related African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Results showed that spiny neurons in the rock hyrax neocortex exhibit less morphological variation than in elephants, displaying a higher frequency of relatively \"typical\" pyramidal neurons. A quantitative comparison of rock hyrax pyramidal neuron morphology between frontal and visual areas, moreover, revealed greater spine density of neurons in frontal cortex, but no differences in other morphological aspects. Regional variations in pyramidal structure have also been observed in the African elephant, as well as a number of primate species." ;

    schema:about "AimThe plant family Goodeniaceae includes 12 genera, largely restricted to Australia. They are a diverse and conspicuous element of the country's ecosystems and an important clade to consider in the effort to reconstruct the historical biogeography of this continent. We used a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny to perform ancestral-area reconstructions for the family, in order to: (1) determine its area of origin; (2) test whether vicariance played a role in the history of lineages occupying the south-western and south-eastern regions; (3) trace diversification processes in the central arid zone; and (4) trace potential eastward dispersals into the Pacific. LocationAustralia and the Pacific. MethodsWe employed a previously published molecular dataset to develop a time-calibrated phylogeny for the Goodeniaceae using beast 1.6.1 with both primary and secondary node calibrations. Ancestral areas were reconstructed via both dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) and statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA). ResultsThe Goodeniaceae split from Asteraceae + Calyceraceae c. 78Ma, with the divergence of the Lechenaultia, Anthotium and Dampiera (LAD) clade from the remainder of the family c. 67Ma. Although the geographical origin of the family is equivocal, the LAD clade originated in south-western Australia, and the remainder of the family, especially Goodenia s.l., probably originated in the central Eremaean zone. The majority of Goodenia cladogenesis events occurred during the Miocene, with expansions to the north, south-east and south-west. The crown radiation of Scaevola s.l. occurred later, during the second half of the Miocene, and has involved several recent extra-Australian dispersals into the Pacific. Main conclusionsAlthough it is unclear where in Australia the family originated, our results support a south-western origin for the LAD clade and considerable diversification of some clades within Goodenia s.l. and Scaevola s.l. in that zone. A relative paucity of mid-Miocene sister relationships between south-western and south-eastern lineages suggests that the occupants of these regions were not affected by contemporary vicariance events. Instead, our results suggest that the aridifying Eremaean zone was an important source and sink for lineages, especially in Goodenia s.l. Dispersal is inferred for the extra-Australian lineages due to their recent origins." ;

    schema:about "Seasonal environmental heterogeneity is cyclic, persistent and geographically widespread. In species that reproduce multiple times annually, environmental changes across seasonal time may create different selection regimes that may shape the population ecology and life history adaptation in these species. Here, we investigate how two closely related species of Drosophila in a temperate orchard respond to environmental changes across seasonal time. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were sampled at four timepoints from June through November to assess seasonal change in fundamental aspects of population dynamics as well as life history traits. D. melanogaster exhibit pronounced change across seasonal time: early in the season, the population is inferred to be uniformly young and potentially represents the early generation following overwintering survivorship. D. melanogaster isofemale lines derived from the early population and reared in a common garden are characterized by high tolerance to a variety of stressors as well as a fast rate of development in the laboratory environment that declines across seasonal time. In contrast, wild D. simulans populations were inferred to be consistently heterogeneous in age distribution across seasonal collections; only starvation tolerance changed predictably over seasonal time in a parallel manner as in D. melanogaster. These results suggest fundamental differences in population and evolutionary dynamics between these two taxa associated with seasonal heterogeneity in environmental parameters and associated selection pressures." ;

    schema:about "In this study, in situ U-Pb monazite ages and Lu-Hf garnet geochronology are used to distinguish mineral parageneses developed during Devonian-Carboniferous and Cretaceous events in migmatitic paragneiss and orthogneiss from the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex in West Antarctica. SHRIMP U-Pb monazite ages define two dominant populations at 365-300Ma (from cores of polychronic grains, dominantly from deeper structural levels in the central and western sectors of the complex) and 120-96Ma (from rims of polychronic grains, dominantly from the central and western sectors of the complex, and from monochronic grains, mostly from shallower structural levels in the eastern sector of the complex). For five paragneisses and two orthogneisses, Lu-Hf garnet ages range from 116 to 111Ma, c. 12-17Ma older than published Sm-Nd garnet ages of 102-99Ma from three of the same samples. Garnet grains in the analysed samples generally have Lu-enriched rims relative to Lu-depleted cores. By contrast, for three of the same samples, individual garnet grains have flat Sm concentrations consistent with high-T diffusive resetting. Lutetium enrichment of garnet rims is interpreted to record the breakdown of a Lu-rich accessory mineral during the final stage of garnet growth immediately prior to the metamorphic peak, and/or the preferential retention of Lu in garnet during breakdown to cordierite in the presence of melt concomitant with the initial stages of exhumation. Therefore, garnet is interpreted to be part of the Cretaceous mineral paragenesis and the Lu-Hf garnet ages are interpreted to record the timing of close-to-peak metamorphism for this event. For the Devonian-Carboniferous event, phase equilibria modelling of the metasedimentary protoliths to the paragneiss and a diatexite migmatite restrict the peak P-T conditions to 720-800 degrees C at 0.45-1.0GPa. For the Cretaceous event, using both forward and inverse phase equilibria modelling of residual paragneiss and orthogneiss compositions, the P-T conditions after decompression are estimated to have been 850-880 degrees C at 0.65-0.80GPa. These P-T conditions occurred between c. 106 and c. 96Ma, determined from Y-enriched rims on monazite that record the timing of garnet and biotite breakdown to cordierite in the presence of melt. The effects of this younger metamorphic event are dominant throughout the Fosdick complex." ;

    schema:about "Determining patterns in annual movements of animals is an important component of population ecology, particularly for migratory birds where migration timing and routes, and wintering habitats have key bearing on population dynamics. From 2009 to 2011, we used light-level geolocators to document the migratory movements of Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus). Four males departed from breeding areas in Colorado for fall migration between 5 and 21 October, arrived in wintering areas in Mexico between 11 October and 3 November, departed from wintering areas from 6 to 21 April, and returned to Colorado between 15 and 21 May. Core wintering areas for three males were located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt Mountains in the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Puebla in central and east-central Mexico, and the core area for the other male was in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains in Tamaulipas. The mean distance from breeding to wintering centroids was 2057 128 km (SE). During fall migration, two males took a southeastern path to eastern Mexico, and two males took a path due south to central Mexico. In contrast, during spring migration, all four males traveled north from Mexico along the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains to the Rio Grande Valley and north through New Mexico. The first stopovers in fall and last stopovers in spring were the longest in duration for all males and located 300-400 km from breeding areas. Final spring stopovers may have allowed male Flammulated Owls to fine tune the timing of their return to high-elevation breeding areas where late snows are not uncommon. One male tracked in both years had similar migration routes, timing, and wintering areas each year. Core wintering and final stopover areas were located primarily in coniferous forests and woodlands, particularly pine-oak forests, suggesting that these are important habitats for Flammulated Owls throughout their annual cycle. RESUMEN El calendario y las rutas de migracion, y las zonas de invernada de Psiloscops flammeolus La determinacion de los patrones de movimientos anuales de los animales es un componente importante de la ecologia de la poblacion, especialmente para las aves migratorias donde el calendario y las rutas de migracion y las zonas de invernada tienen una influencia clave en la dinamica de poblaciones. Desde 2009-2011, se utilizo geolocalizadores sensibles a la luz para documentar los movimientos migratorios de tecolotes flameados (Psiloscops flammeolus). Cuatro machos abandonaron las zonas de reproduccion en Colorado para la migracion de otono entre el 5 al 21 de octubre, luego llegaron al sitio de invernada en Mexico entre el 11 de octubre y el 3 de noviembre, y finalmente abandonaron los sitios de invernada entre el 6 al 21 de abril y regresaron a Colorado entre el 15 y el 21 de mayo. Para tres machos las zonas nucleo de invernada fueron localizadas en las montanas del Cinturon Volcanico Trans-Mexicanos en los estados de Jalisco, Michoacan y Puebla en el centro y el centro-este de Mexico. La zona nucleo del otro macho fue ubicada en las montanas de la Sierra Madre Oriental en Tamaulipas. La distancia media entre las centroides de las zonas de cria y invernada era 2057 +/- 128 (SE) km. Durante la migracion de otono, dos machos tomaron una ruta sudeste hasta el este de Mexico, y otros dos machos tomaron una ruta al sur hasta el centro de Mexico. Durante la migracion de primavera, en cambio, los cuatro machos viajaron al norte desde Mexico a lo largo de las montanas de la Sierra Madre Oriental en el Valle del Rio Grande y al norte a traves de Nuevo Mexico. En el curso de migracion en otono y en primavera, las primeras paradas fueron los mas largos de duracion de todas paradas de los machos y estaban situados entre 300 y 400 km de las zonas de reproduccion. Las paradas finales de primavera pueden haber permitido los buhos machos a ajustar el momento de su regreso a las zonas de cria a altitud elevada, donde no es raro que nieva a fines de la primavera. Un macho seguido en ambos anos tenia el calendario, las rutas de migracion, y las zonas de invernada similares cada ano. Zonas nucleo de invernada y de paradas definitiva fueron localizadas principalmente en bosques de coniferas y en bosques de pino y encino en particular, lo que sugiere que estos bosques son habitats importantes para Psiloscops flammeolus a lo largo de su ciclo anual." ;

    schema:about "The age of the sedimentary basement of the Ganga Valley in northern India, which is represented by the entirely subsurface Ganga Supergroup, is key for addressing issues related to the tectonic history of the Himalaya. However, the stratigraphic correlations between the Ganga Supergroup in the Ganga Valley, the Vindhyan Supergroup in cratonic India to the south, and Proterozoic successions in the Lesser Himalaya to the north have long been a matter of controversy. This is largely because of the poor age constraint of the Madhubani Group of the upper Ganga Supergroup, which has been variously interpreted as Proterozoic, lower Palaeozoic, or even Mesozoic. To address this issue, we used a low manipulation maceration technique to extract organic-walled microfossils from the Ujhani and Tilhar formations of the lower Madhubani Group. Our study recovered a total of 24 taxa, including Devisphaera corallis gen. et sp. nov. The co-occurrence of Trachyhystrichosphaera aimika, Caudosphaera expansa and Annulusia annulata in the lower Madhubani Group indicates a late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic age. Thus, the biostratigraphical data suggest a > 300 myr depositional gap between the Madhubani Group and the immediately underlying Bahraich Group, which has been independently constrained to be upper Palaeoproterozoic to lower Mesoproterozoic in age. Therefore, the first-order stratigraphic architecture, with a Palaeoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic succession unconformably overlain by a Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic succession, is closely similar throughout the Vindhyan Basin, Ganga Valley and Lesser Himalaya, suggesting a shared sedimentary and tectonic history among them." ;

    schema:about "Philosophers working in bioethics often hope to identify abstract principles and universal values to guide professional practice, relying on ideals of objectivity and impartiality, and on the power of rational (individual, autonomous) deliberation. Such a focus has made it difficult to address issues arising from group-based, sociohistorical differences like race and ethnicity. This essay offers a survey of some of the major issues concerning race in the field of bioethics. These issues include a long history of racialized abuse in medical and scientific research, reproductive injustice and abuse against women of color, and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in U.S. health and health care. The essay also argues that the field of bioethics as a whole would be improved by taking the experience of racial minorities into account in all its theorizing. Philosophers can aid in this task by expanding their theoretical focus beyond questions of individual rights to questions of social justice, beyond informed consent to community collaboration, and beyond cultural competency to both structural competency and cultural humility." ;

    schema:about "Prior studies estimating the impact of amenity accessibility on residential property prices have largely treated housing as a homogenous commodity; however, there is strong evidence that differentiation in metropolitan housing submarkets matters. Using a hedonic pricing approach and controlling for spatial effects, this paper examines the preferences of house and apartment buyers regarding amenity accessibility in Brooklyn, New York, between 2008 and 2013. Amenity preferences between the two types of homebuyers are indeed different. The marginal implicit value of accessibility to cultural amenities is greater to apartment than house buyers, while the marginal implicit value of workplace amenity accessibility is greater to house than apartment buyers. The results illustrate the importance of differentiating housing submarkets when estimating these impacts. Urban policy-makers and real estate developers can use these results to inform land use planning in metropolitan areas aimed at further increasing residential property values.

    schema:about "A variety of unusual early post-depositional deformation structures exist in grainstone and flat-pebble conglomerate beds of Upper Cambrian strata, western Colorado, including slide scarps, thrusted beds, irregular blocks and internally deformed beds. Thrusted beds up to tens of centimetres thick record thrust movement of a part of a bed onto itself along a moderate to steeply inclined (15 degrees to 40 degrees) ramp, locally producing hanging wall lenses with fault-bend geometries. Thrust plane orientations are widely distributed, and in some cases nearly oppositely oriented in close proximity, indicating that they did not form as failures acted upon by gravity forces. Irregular bedded to internally deformed blocks are isolated on generally flat upper bedding surfaces. These features represent parts of beds that detached, moved up onto and some distances across, the laterally adjacent undisturbed bed surfaces. Deformation of thin intervals of mud on the ocean floor by moving blocks rules out the possibility of storm-induced deformation, because the mud was not eroded by high shear stresses that would accompany the extremely large forces required to produce and move the blocks. Finally, internally deformed beds are characterized by large blocks, fitted fabrics of highly irregular fragments and contorted lamination, which represent heterogeneous deformation, such as brecciation and liquefaction. The deformation structures were produced by earthquakes linked to the reactivation of Mesoproterozoic, crustal-scale shear zones in the central Rockies during the Late Cambrian. Analysis of the deformation structures indicates very large body forces and calculated earthquake-generated ground motion velocities of ca 1.6 m sec(-1). These correspond to moment magnitudes of ca 7.0 or more and a Mercalli Intensity of X+. These are the only known magnitude estimates of Phanerozoic (other than Quaternary) large-intensity earthquakes for the Rocky Mountain region, and they are as large as, or larger than, previous estimates of Proterozoic earthquakes along these major shear zones of the central Rockies." ;

    schema:about "In this article, we ask how well people fulfill informational motives by using the judgments of others. We build on advice-taking research from the judgment and decision making literature, which has developed a distinct paradigm to test how accurately people incorporate information from others. We use a literature review to show that people have mixed success in fulfilling informational motives -- they increase their accuracy through the use of advice, but not as much as they could. We develop insights about how people perceive advisors and try to pursue advice -- and where their perceptions may lead them astray. We conclude by proposing that future work further investigate the reasons people fail to use advice by building on the current advice taking paradigm used in judgment and decision making, but with a richer understanding of advice taking as a dynamic process that often entails complex decisions and normative motives.

    schema:about "Objective Human trafficking problems have largely been framed by political elites and the media as a sexual crime involving innocent victims who are largely women and children. It is unclear how this framing impacts the public's attitudes about the issue. Here, we ask what types of sex trafficking victim frames produce the strongest response among the American public and how does increased exposure and accurate knowledge about the issue moderate the impact of the victim frames? Methods To answer these questions, we utilize data from a unique nationally representative survey experiment fielded to 2,000 Americans in which we designed a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment manipulating the gender, age, and nationality of sex trafficking victims. Results We find the age of the victim has the greatest impact on affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to human trafficking, but that these victim frames are conditional on the amount of exposure a subject has had to the issue of human trafficking and the level of correct knowledge he or she possesses about human trafficking. Conclusion Victim framing in public discourse on sex trafficking does make a difference, and the reasons these frames elicit different responses are complex and moderated by respondents’ exposure to information and knowledge about the issue.

    schema:about "The Himalayan Foreland Basin in the Ganga Valley is key to assessing the pre-collision relationship between cratonic India and the Himalaya - the world's largest mountain chain. The subsurface Ganga Supergroup, representing the sedimentary basement of the Ganga Valley, has been interpreted as a northern extension of the Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup in cratonic India. This interpretation is contentious because the depositional age of the Ganga Supergroup is not resolved: whereas the lower Ganga Supergroup is widely regarded as Proterozoic, the upper Ganga Supergroup has been variously inferred to include Neoproterozoic, lower Palaeozoic, or Cretaceous strata. Here, we integrate biostratigraphic and detrital zircon data from drill cores to show that the entire Ganga Supergroup is likely Proterozoic and can be correlated with Proterozoic successions on the northern Indian craton and in the Lesser Himalaya. This helps redefine the first-order stratigraphic architecture and indicates broad depositional continuity along the northern Indian margin during the Proterozoic." ;

    schema:about "The advent of new and social media, and Twitter in particular, has not only revolutionized how we communicate with each other, but also how we learn and teach. Twitter is increasingly incorporated across the disciplines as a tool to engage with content. In the foreign-language classroom, for instance, Twitter has been used to facilitate language learning, communicate with native speakers, and build community. This article describes how Twitter was initially introduced into an intermediate German classroom to improve communicative competence and foster student engagement. Yet its main focus is on how Twitter was used as the only method of instruction as part of the discussion of Thomas Brussig's 1999 novel Am kurzeren Ende der Sonnenallee. The first section explains the methodology behind using Twitter, and briefly charts the advantages and disadvantages of the social networking tool for honing communicative skills and building community. The second section outlines the classroom unit during which the students and the instructor communicated solely via Twitter. After a discussion of the session, and sample student assignments and reactions, the article concludes by highlighting the educational benefits of Twitter as a playful and motivating approach to teaching literature in the intermediate foreign-language classroom." ;

    schema:about "This paper extends the study of current account (CA) reversals by considering the implications for the composition of output and employment. It is shown that decreases in CA deficits imply increases in tradable relative to non-tradable output and/or declines in investment. The impact of CA rebalancing' should therefore be expected to vary considerably across sectors of an economy. This intersectoral variation is studied by examining the dynamics of output, employment and prices using data for 55 sectors of the economy during 14 industrial country reversal episodes. The output and employment declines associated with CA reversals are most clearly evident in investment-related sectors, while sectors related to primary commodities generally perform relatively well following reversals. Reversals are also followed by increases in relative inflation for tradable goods sectors." ;

    schema:about "Abrupt perturbations of the global carbon cycle during the early Eocene are associated with rapid global warming events, which are analogous in many ways to present greenhouse warming. Mammal dwarfing has been observed, alongwith other changes in community structure, during the largest of these ancient global warming events, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM; similar to 56 million years ago (Ma)]. We show that mammalian dwarfing accompanied the subsequent, smaller-magnitude warming event known as Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 [ETM2 (similar to 53 Ma)]. Statistically significant decrease in body size during ETM2 is observed in two of four taxonomic groups analyzed in this study andis most clearly observed inearly equids (horses). During ETM2, the best-sampledlineage of equids decreased in size by similar to 14%, as opposed to similar to 30% during the PETM. Thus, dwarfing appears to be a common evolutionary response of somemammals during past globalwarming events, and the extent of dwarfing seems related to the magnitude of the event." ;

Species cover data and header data are stored in a Turboveg database. A standardized Pan Arctic Species List provides a consistent nomenclature for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens in the archive. A web-based online Alaska Arctic Geoecological Atlas (AGA-AK) allows viewing and downloading the species data in a variety of formats, and provides access to a wide variety of ancillary data. We conducted a preliminary cluster analysis of the first 16 datasets (1,613 plots) to examine how the spectrum of derived clusters is related to the suite of datasets, habitat types, and environmental gradients. We present the contents of the archive, assess its strengths and weaknesses, and provide three supplementary files that include the data dictionary, a list of habitat types, an overview of the datasets, and details of the cluster analysis." ;

    schema:about "Vibrio fischeri quorum sensing involves the LuxI and LuxR proteins. The LuxI protein generates the quorum-sensing signal N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL), and LuxR is a signal-responsive transcriptional regulator which activates the luminescence (lux) genes and 17 other V. fischeri genes. For activation of the lux genes, LuxR binds to a 20-base-pair inverted repeat, the lux box, which is centered 42.5 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start of the lux operon. Similar lux box-like elements have been identified in only a few of the LuxR-activated V. fischeri promoters. To better understand the DNA sequence elements required for LuxR binding and to identify binding sites in LuxR-regulated promoters other than the lux operon promoter, we have systematically mutagenized the lux box and evaluated the activity of many mutants. By doing so, we have identified nucleotides that are critical for promoter activity. Interestingly, certain lux box mutations allow a 3OC6-HSL-independent LuxR activation of the lux operon promoter. We have used the results of the mutational analysis to create a consensus lux box, and we have used this consensus sequence to identify LuxR binding sites in 3OC6-HSL-activated genes for which lux boxes could not be identified previously.

    schema:about "Spt6 is a conserved factor, critically required for several transcription- and chromatin-related processes. We now show that Spt6 and its binding partner, Iws1, are required for heterochromatic silencing in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our studies demonstrate that Spt6 is required for silencing of all heterochromatic loci and that an spt6 mutant has an unusual combination of heterochromatic phenotypes compared to previously studied silencing mutants. Unexpectedly, we find normal nucleosome positioning over heterochromatin and normal levels of histone H3K9 dimethylation at the endogenous pericentric repeats. However, we also find greatly reduced levels of H3K9 trimethylation, elevated levels of H3K14 acetylation, reduced recruitment of several silencing factors, and defects in heterochromatin spreading. Our evidence suggests that Spt6 plays a role at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels; in an spt6 mutant, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy at the pericentric regions is only modestly increased, while production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is lost. Taken together, our results suggest that Spt6 is required for multiple steps in heterochromatic silencing by controlling chromatin, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional processes." ;

    schema:about "Tools for visualizing data provide an opportunity for students to build useful understanding of geoscience vocabularies. Edelson's (2001) Learning-for-Use framework serves as an instructional model for designing an experience for students in which they can learn fundamental geoscience concepts. This paper presents results from an experiment on project-based learning with three cohorts (in subsequent semesters) of preservice elementary teachers. The context for the experiment was a capstone science course for preservice elementary teachers. The project consisted of six steps in which students were instructed to create a paleotemperature map of the Late Jurassic. Students made their decisions based on their constructed knowledge about factors that influence near-surface air temperature: latitude (axial tilt and curvature), topography and subsequent lapse rate, atmospheric effect, and surface cover (albedo). Analyses of reflection papers and classroom observations from each step in the project indicated improvement in content knowledge for all student cohorts. However, regarding the ability to perform complex analysis, only students who successfully built new geoscience vocabularies performed better on predicting and defending their final temperature maps. This is attributed to their ability to use, not just define the geoscience vocabularies contained in the project." ;

    schema:about "This field-trip guide outlines the glacial history of the upper Arkansas River valley, Colorado, and builds on a previous GSA field trip to the area in 2010. The following will be presented: (1) new cosmogenic (super 10) Be exposure ages of moraine boulders from the Pinedale and Bull Lake glaciations (Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 6, respectively) located adjacent to the Twin Lakes Reservoir, (2) numerical modeling of glaciers during the Pinedale glaciation in major tributaries draining into the upper Arkansas River, (3) discharge estimates for glacial-lake outburst floods in the upper Arkansas River valley, and (4) (super 10) Be ages on flood boulders deposited downvalley from the moraine sequences. This research was stimulated by a new geologic map of the Granite 7.5' quadrangle, in which the mapping of surficial deposits was revised based in part on the interpretation of newly acquired LiDAR data and field investigations. The new (super 10) Be ages of the Pinedale terminal moraine at Twin Lakes average 21.8 + or - 0.7 ka (n = 14), which adds to nearby Pinedale terminal moraine ages of 23.6 + or - 1.4 ka (n = 5), 20.5 + or - 0.2 ka (n = 3), and 16.6 + or - 1.0 ka (n = 7), and downvalley outburst flood terraces that date to 20.9 + or - 0.9 ka (n = 4) and 19.0 + or - 0.6 ka (n = 4). This growing chronology leads to improved understanding of the controls and timing of glaciation in the western United States, the modeling of glacial-lake outburst flooding, and the reconstruction of paleotemperature through glacier modeling." ;

    schema:about "We report geochemical data from (meta-) sedimentary and igneous rocks that crop out in the Ford Ranges of western Marie Byrd Land and discuss the evolution and reworking of the crust in this region during Paleozoic subduction along the former Gondwanan convergent plate margin. Detrital zircon age spectra from the Swanson Formation, a widespread low-grade metaturbidite sequence, define distinct populations in the late Paleoproterozoic, late Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic-Cambrian. The late Paleoproterozoic group records magmatism derived from a mixed juvenile and crustal source. By contrast, the late Mesoproterozoic group yields Hf isotope values consistent with derivation from a juvenile Mesoproterozoic source inferred to be an unexposed Grenville-age orogenic belt beneath the East Antarctic ice sheet. For the NeoproterozoicCambrian population, Hf isotope values indicate reworking of these older materials during Ross-Delamerian orogenesis. New U-Pb ages from the Devonian- Carboniferous Ford Granodiorite suite across the Ford Ranges reveal an extended period of arc magmatism from 375 to 345 Ma. For four younger samples of Ford Granodiorite, Hf and O isotope values in zircon suggest involvement of a larger (meta-) sedimentary component in the petrogenesis than for two older samples. This contrasts with the secular trend toward more juvenile values documented from Silurian to Permian granite suites in the Tasmanides of eastern Australia and Famennian to Tournasian granite suites in New Zealand, pieces of continental crust that were once contiguous with western Marie Byrd Land along the Gondwana margin. The differences may relate to an along-arc change from the typical extensional accretionary mode in eastern Australia to a neutral or an advancing mode in West Antarctica, and to an across-arc difference in distance from the trench between the New Zealand fragments of Zealandia and western Marie Byrd Land. Upper Devonian anatectic granites in the Ford Ranges most likely record reworking of early Ford Granodiorite suite members during arc magmatism." ;

    schema:about "Cambrian-Ordovician strata of the North China block, one of China's main tectonic provinces, are a thick (up to 1800 m) succession of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. Sedimentological, biostratigraphic, and chemostratigraphic analysis of strata that straddle the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary at the Subaiyingou section in the present-day western part of Inner Mongolia (northwest China) indicate the presence of a significant unconformity between mixed carbonate-fine-siliciclastic strata of the Cambrian Series 3 Abuqiehai Formation, and dominantly carbonate strata of the early Middle Ordovician Sandaokan Formation. The latter is a transgressive systems tract with retrogradationally stacked parasequences that include lowstand shore-line quartz sandstone deposits. The Abuqiehai strata have similar sedimentological characteristics to those of the Cambrian Laurentian inner detrital belt, including slightly bioturbated lime mudstone and marlstone/shale, grainstone, flat-pebble conglomerate, and microbialite. The lower part of the Sandaokan Formation records the rising limb of the middle Darriwilian positive isotopic excursion, recognized herein for the first time in the western North China block. A Cambrian-Ordovician unconformity is developed in many successions globally, and our section in Inner Mongolia records a hiatus of similar timing and duration to a regionally extensive unconformity recorded along the ancient northern Indian continental margin. Other parts of the North China block record a hiatus of much shorter duration but show a similar record of input of siliciclastic sediment above the unconformity. We interpret the western margin of the North China block to have been affected by a regionally significant tectonic event that occurred on the northern margin of east Gondwana, the Kurgiakh or Bhimphedian orogeny. The Inner-Mongolian region was, therefore, likely an along-strike continuation of the northern Indian margin, in contrast to most recent paleogeographic reconstructions." ;

    schema:about "An early Paleozoic tectonic event, the Kurgiakh orogeny, has long been known from the western Tethyan Himalaya, and it is conspicuously recorded by an angular unconformity between Cambrian marine shelf deposits and coarse Ordovician conglomerate, as well as widespread granitic plutons. Although the lateral extent of this event is poorly known, two regions in the central and eastern Himalaya, the Kumaon of India and klippen of Bhutan, contain conglomerate units that may be correlative with this event. In the Kumaon, the Ralam Formation, which contains a basal polymictic conglomerate unit with detrital zircon grains as young as ca. 512 Ma, is overlain by sandstone containing the arthropod walking trace Diplichnites gouldi, an ichnospecies known from Ordovician and younger strata. The late early Cambrian trilobite Redlichia sp., recovered from the underlying Martoli Group, indicates that the conglomerate is post-early Cambrian and, based on stratigraphic analysis, also likely records the Kurgiakh orogeny. In central Bhutan, the lower Paleozoic succession contains conglomerate units with monomictic quartz sandstone clasts and less mature sandstone matrix. These units have also been assigned to a variety of ages, but rocks that apparently underlie these strata contain the Furongian (late Cambrian) zonal trilobite Kaolishania granulosa. Here, we show that detrital zircon ages of a conglomerate clast (no grains younger than = ca. 781 Ma) are distinctly older than those of the matrix, which contains a large peak at 490-500 Ma. Thus, these conglomerate units are also potential lateral correlatives of the Ordovician conglomerate deposits of the western Himalaya. Our paleontological and geochronologic data suggest that the Kumaon and Bhutan conglomerate units, and possible equivalents in Tibet, correlate with those of the western Himalaya. This increases their known along-strike extent by over 1000 km, bringing the total extent to similar to 1200 km. Thus, the Kurgiakh orogeny spanned much of the Himalayan orogen along the northern Gondwanan margin and reflected a widespread tectonic reorganization of the peri-Gondwanan realm to Andean-type margins. Recent work indicates that it also likely extended into the Lhasa block and both the North and South China blocks. This event was associated with widespread ca. 500 Ma arc-related plutonism recorded in the Himalaya, and with abundant detrital zircon grains of that age in younger Himalaya strata. Based on current fossil data, the duration of the hiatus associated with the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary, which separates pre- and post-deformational strata, ranges from 22 to 36 m.y. Available geochronological data do not provide greater constraint. If the event was close in age to the depositional age of the Ordovician molasse, then the main phase of tectonic uplift, erosion, and deposition may have been much later than the presumed Cambrian-Ordovician boundary interval age of ca. 485 Ma." ;

These data are combined with published glacial chronologies across the western United States, and indicate that although the ages of Pinedale terminal moraines vary within individual ranges as well as regionally, most western United States glaciers remained near their Pinedale termini until ca. 16 ka, at which time widespread deglaciation commenced. We hypothesize that the near-synchronous demise of glaciers across the western U. S. between ca. 15 and ca. 13 ka was driven by the first major Northern Hemisphere warming following the Last Glacial Maximum, but that some differences in Pinedale culmination ages can be explained by nonclimatic factors intrinsic to individual valleys. These results suggest the need for caution in focusing exclusively on climate forcings to explain apparent asynchrony in Pinedale maxima." ;

    schema:about "The snowball Earth hypothesis predicts that low-latitude glaciation lasted millions of years while CO2 built up to critical levels to culminate in catastrophic deglaciation in a supergreenhouse climate. The Gaskiers Formation of eastern Newfoundland (Canada) has been attributed to a snowball glaciation event, but the lack of robust paleo-magnetic data and precise geochronological constraints has precluded tests of the hypothesis. Here we present high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology (chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry) from eight tuffs from multiple distant stratigraphic sections that bracket glacial diamictites and the first appearance of large Ediacaran fossils. Including internal error, deposition of the Gaskiers diamictite on the Avalon Peninsula is constrained to have been between 580.90 +/- 0.40 and 579.88 +/- 0.44 Ma, and the Trinity diamictite on Bonavista Peninsula was deposited between 579.63 +/- 0.15 and 579.24 +/- 0.17 Ma. Assuming approximately synchronous deglaciation, these results imply a maximum duration for deposition of the Trinity diamictite of <= 340 k.y.; this is inconsistent with the multimillion year duration predicted by the snowball Earth hypothesis. Our geochronologic data also constrain the first appearance datum of Ediacaran fossils to <9.5 m.y. after the Gaskiers glaciation. Thus, despite existing paleomagnetic constraints that indicate that marine ice sheets extended to low to middle latitudes, it appears that Earth narrowly escaped a third Neoproterozoic snowball glaciation just prior to the late Ediacaran expansion of metazoan ecosystems." ;

    schema:about "Variation in light availability likely impacts the processes that determine the identity of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the host plant, and the resulting changes in fungal composition may modify the plant's growth response to light. Our two field surveys and two field experiments using Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. seedlings show that the identity of the dominant ectomycorrhizal fungus changed in response to natural and experimentally induced variation in light. Plants in low light were mostly dominated by a Cenococcum-like morphotype, and plants in high light were mostly dominated by a Lactarius-like morphotype. The patterns of absolute abundance show the key role of plant size: the absolute abundance of the Lactarius-like morphotype increased with increasing light and increasing root system size, whereas the absolute abundance of the Cenococcum-like morphotype was unrelated to both variables. Root system size increased with light availability. With increasing light, growth of plants dominated by the Lactarius-like morphotype decreased with respect to average plants, and therefore, as the Lac, morphotype was increasing in dominance, it was decreasing in mutualistic effectiveness. Plants dominated by Cenococcum had lower growth compared with plants dominated by Lactarius in low light. However, the effects of the two morphotypes were indistinguishable in high light. Our results are likely driven by an interaction of priority effects and light-limited plant growth." ;

The N-terminal 112 amino acids of HilA are similar to winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding/transcription activation domains (wHTH DBDs). The remaining 441 amino acids are not similar in sequence to any other well-characterized transcription factors. Here, we report that the wHTH DBD is essential for activation of both promoters, but amino acids 113-554 are only required for normal activation of invF-1. Some alanine substitutions in the putative alpha loop, which connects the recognition and positioning helices in wHTH DBDs, cause a loss-of-activation phenotype. A hilA allele encoding a protein with an alanine substituted for arginine at position 71 in the alpha loop has a loss-of-activation defect exclusively at the prgH promoter. The results suggest distinct roles for one or more domains formed by amino acids 113-554 and for arginine 71 in activation of the 2 promoters." ;

    schema:about "Vibrio fischeri are bioluminescent marine bacteria that can be isolated from their symbiotic animal partners or from ocean water. A V. fischeri population increases exponentially inside the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) while the host is quiescent during the day. This bacterial light organ population reaches stationary phase and then remains high during the night, when the squid use bacterial bioluminescence as a counter-predation strategy. At dawn, host squid release 90%-95% of the light organ contents into the ocean water prior to burying in the sand for the day. As the squid sleeps, the cycle of bacterial population growth in the light organ begins again. These V. fischeri cells that are vented into the ocean must persist under typical marine low nutrient conditions until they encounter another opportunity to colonize a host. We hypothesized that because V. fischeri regularly encounter cycles of feast and famine in nature, they would exhibit the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype. We found that older V. fischeri cells exhibit a Class 2 GASP response in which old cells increase dramatically in frequency while the population of young V. fischeri cells remains almost constant during co-incubation." ;

    schema:about "We investigated the Acinetobacter baylyi gene ACIAD1960, known from previous work to be expressed during long-term stationary phase. The protein encoded by this gene had been annotated as a Conserved Hypothetical Protein, surrounded by putative tellurite resistance (\"Ter\") proteins. Sequence analysis suggested that the protein belongs to the DUF1796 putative papain-like protease family. Here, we show that the purified protein, subsequently named StiP, has cysteine protease activity. Deletion of stiP causes hypersensitivity to tellurite, altered population dynamics during long-term batch culture, and most strikingly, dramatic alteration of normal cell morphology. StiP and associated Ter proteins (the StiP-Ter cluster) are therefore important for regulating cell morphology, likely in response to oxidative damage or depletion of intracellular thiol pools, triggered artificially by tellurite exposure. Our finding has broad significance because while tellurite is an extremely rare compound in nature, oxidative damage, the need to maintain a particular balance of intracellular thiols, and the need to regulate cell morphology are ubiquitous." ;

Here we focus on the natural transformation of A. baylyi ATCC 33305 grown in complex media and seek environmental conditions that appreciably affect transformation efficiency. We find that the transformation efficiency for A. baylyi is a resilient characteristic that remains high under most conditions tested. We do find several distinct conditions that alter natural transformation efficiency including addition of succinate, Fe2+ (ferrous) iron chelation, and substitution of sodium ions with potassium ones. These distinct conditions could be useful to fine tune transformation efficiency for researchers using A. baylyi as a model organism to study natural transformation." ;

    schema:about "The present study quantitatively compared the basilar dendritic/spine systems of lamina V pyramidal neurons across four hierarchically arranged regions of neonatal human neocortex. Tissue blocks were removed from four Brodmann's areas (BAs) in the left hemisphere of four neurologically normal neonates (mean age = 41 +/- 40 days): primary (BA4 and BA3-1-2), unimodal (BA18), and supramodal cortices (BA10). Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Ten cells per region (N = 160) were quantified. Despite the small sample size, significant differences in dendritic/spine extent obtained across cortical regions. Most apparent were substantial differences between BA4 and BA10: total dendritic length was 52% greater in BA4 than BA10, and dendritic spine number was 67% greater in BA4 than BA10. Neonatal patterns were compared to adult patterns, revealing that the relative regional pattern of dendritic complexity in the neonate was roughly the inverse of that established in the adult, with BA10 rather than BA4 being the most complex area in the adult. Overall, regional dendritic patterns suggest that the developmental time course of basilar dendritic systems is heterochronous and is more protracted for supramodal BA10 than for primary or unimodal regions (BA4, BA3-1-2, BA18).

    schema:about "The current study provides a number of novel observations on the organization and structure of the cerebellar cortex of the African elephant by using a combination of basic neuroanatomical and immunohistochemical stains with Golgi and stereologic analysis. While the majority of our observations indicate that the cerebellar cortex of the African elephant is comparable to other mammalian species, several features were unique to the elephant. The three-layered organization of the cerebellar cortex, the neuronal types and some aspects of the expression of calcium-binding proteins were common to a broad range of mammalian species. The Lugaro neurons observed in the elephant were greatly enlarged in comparison to those of other large-brained mammals, suggesting a possible alteration in the processing of neural information in the elephant cerebellar cortex. Analysis of Golgi impregnations indicated that the dendritic complexity of the different interneuron types was higher in elephants than other mammals. Expression of parvalbumin in the parallel fibers and calbindin expressed in the stellate and basket cells also suggested changes in the elephant cerebellar neuronal circuitry. The stereologic analysis confirmed and extended previous observations by demonstrating that neuronal density is low in the elephant cerebellar cortex, providing for a larger volume fraction of the neuropil. With previous results indicating that the elephants have the largest relative cerebellar size amongst mammals, and one of the absolutely largest mammalian cerebella, the current observations suggest that the elephants have a greater volume of a potentially more complexly organized cerebellar cortex compared to other mammals. This quantitatively larger and more complex cerebellar cortex likely represents part of the neural machinery required to control the complex motor patterns involved in movement of the trunk and the production of infrasonic vocalizations.

    schema:about "The current study investigates neuron morphology in presumptive primary somatosensory (S1) and primary visual (V1) cortices of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) as revealed by Golgi impregnation. Sirenians, including manatees, have an aquatic lifestyle, a large body size, and a relatively large lissencephalic brain. The present study examines neuron morphology in 3 cortical areas: in S1, dorsolateral cortex area 1 (DL1) and cluster cortex area 2 (CL2) and in V1, dorsolateral cortex area 4 (DL4). Neurons exhibited a variety of morphological types, with pyramidal neurons being the most common. The large variety of neuron types present in the manatee cortex was comparable to that seen in other eutherian mammals, except for rodents and primates, where pyramid-shaped neurons predominate. A comparison between pyramidal neurons in S1 and V1 indicated relatively greater dendritic branching in S1. Across all 3 areas, the dendritic arborization pattern of pyramidal neurons was also similar to that observed previously in the afrotherian rock hyrax, cetartiodactyls, opossums, and echidnas but did not resemble the widely bifurcated dendrites seen in the large-brained African elephant. Despite adaptations for an aquatic environment, manatees did not share specific neuron types such as tritufted and star-like neurons that have been found in cetaceans. Manatees exhibit an evolutionarily primitive pattern of cortical neuron morphology shared with most other mammals and do not appear to have neuronal specializations for an aquatic niche. (C) 2016 S.

    schema:about "Most of the species studied in this paper have previously been placed in either Pleurothallis or Lepanthes. However, at one time or another, members of the group have also been placed in the genera Andinia, Brachycladium, Lueranthos, Masdeval-liantha, Neooreophilus, Oreophilus, Penducella, Salpistele and Xenosia. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ITS and plastid matK sequences indicate that these species form a strongly supported clade that is only distantly related to Lepanthes and is distinct from Pleurothallis and Salpistele. Since this clade includes the type species of Andinia, A. dielsii, and it has taxonomic precedence over all other generic names belonging to this group, Andinia is re-circumscribed and expanded to include 72 species segregated into five subgenera: Aenigma, Andinia, Brachycladium, Masdevalliantha and Minuscula. The required taxonomic transfers are made herein. We hypothesize that convergent evolution towards a similar pollinator syndrome involving deceit pollination via pseudocopulation by Diptera resulted in a similar floral morphology between species of subgenus Brachycladium and species of Lepanthes; hence the prior placement of the species of subgenus Brachycladium in Lepanthes. Species of the re-circumscribed Andinia are confined exclusively to the Andes, ranging from about 1,200 to 3,800 m, from Colombia south to Bolivia, making the generic name very apt. Elevational distributions of the individual clades are discussed in relation to the possible evolutionary diversification of the most species-rich clade, subgenus Brachycladium." ;

Changes in the pigments used at different times have been invaluable in detecting incongruities that suggest fraud, but relatively little work has been published that uses the chemical changes in oil binders as they dry to determine when an ink print or an oil painting was made. Using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy and samples with known dates, we calibrate the drying of oil binders in inks and paints and cross-validate the paints with pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). We apply the ink calibration to a case study involving the age determination of possible philatelic counterfeits from a World War II Jewish Ghetto in Occupied Poland, obtaining a date of 1946 +/- 6 (1 s, n = 9) for the genuine stamps, and 1963 +/- 16 (1 s, n = 19) for the various reproductions." ;

Santa Eulalia is situated in the center of the Kanjobal Indian region in the department of Huehuetenango in Guatemala. The department of Huehuetenango is located in the western Altiplano region of the country, a region in which the Indian population is primarily concentrated. Although no firm estimates exist on the total number of indigenous Guatemalans, analysts assert that over 40 percent of the country's 9 million inhabitants are Indians. The Kanjobales are one of 22 distinct indigenous groups in Guatemala and are the descendants of the Mayan Indians. The Quiches, Mames, Cakchiqueles and Kechis are the most numerous, perhaps numbering 3 million persons. The remaining groups in size with the Kanjobales numbering perhaps 100,000-150,000. International migration to the U.S. from the Kanjobal region of northern Huehuetenango can be characterized as having occurred in three distinct stages: pioneer, war refugee and youth-driven migration, and was preceded by internal migration in the 1940-70 period." ;

Its point of departure is the American Founding, a subject often invisible in both the history of international thought and contemporary International Relations theory. Although usually considered as an incident within the domestic politics of the United States, the Founding displays many key ideas that have subsequently played a vital role in both international political thought and IR theory. The purpose of this essay is to explore these ideas and to take account of their passage through time, up to and including the present day. Those ideas shine a light not only on how we organize our scholarly enterprises but also on the contemporary direction of US foreign policy and the larger question of world order." ;

    schema:about "This study examines partnerships between the military and local communities by exploring communication channels of the U.S. military and civilian agencies that provide services to transitioning military members. This article reports on a study conducted in 2013 in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area, designed to determine the degree to which the military enters into partnerships with civilian service providers. We find that navy agencies in Hampton Roads do work with community partners, but the military is more directive than one might imagine in a true partnership, leading to \"uneasy\" partnerships. Additionally, there are important structural and organizational barriers that prevent true partnerships from developing between navy agencies and the community providers." ;

    schema:about "Social interaction is a central feature of people's life and engages a variety of cognitive resources. Thus, social interaction should facilitate general cognitive functioning. Previous studies suggest such a link, but they used special populations (e. g., elderly with cognitive impairment), measured social interaction indirectly (e. g., via marital status), and only assessed effects of extended interaction in correlational designs. Here the relation between mental functioning and direct indicators of social interaction was examined in a younger and healthier population. Study 1 using survey methodology found a positive relationship between social interaction, assessed via amount of actual social contact, and cognitive functioning in people from three age groups including younger adults. Study 2 using an experimental design found that a small amount of social interaction (10 min) can facilitate cognitive performance. The findings are discussed in the context of the benefits social relationships have for so many aspects of people's lives." ;

    schema:about "Carbon market projects have focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, often at the expense of achieving sustainable development goals. A central pillar in sustainable development is equity, yet most projects pay little attention to equity implications for underrepresented farmers, especially women. Agricultural carbon market projects that explicitly seek to promote sustainable agricultural land management practices are quickly gaining attention worldwide for their promise to deliver the 'triple-win': adaptation, food security, and mitigation. Previous experience with other payment for ecosystem services projects indicate that women often are marginalized and their needs ignored. To address this gap, this case study examined the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project with a focus on gender equity in access, decision making, and outcomes. Results show that women had less access to joining the project than men, because they did not have the same level of influence in decision making at a household level. At the project level, both men and women had little influence in establishing project requirements and potential benefits, as these were decided upon prior to farmer recruitment. Regarding outcomes, women tended to participate in more project activities, and would in return reap more nonmonetary benefits than men. However, the costs involved in achieving these benefits was nontrivial: women's farm labor time increased significantly due to the substantial time and effort required to implement sustainable agricultural land management practices. If agricultural soil carbon market projects are to achieve better outcomes by addressing equity issues, they need to pay special attention to gender and the differing needs of farmers--male, female, young, old, poor, and less poor--by involving them at the project design stage. Our findings show the importance of additional project benefits unrelated to carbon income for addressing the requirements of equity perceived by both the implementing agency and women themselves." ;

    schema:about "Over the past decade, more than 25 U.S. states enacted legislation surrounding abortions. By analyzing state abortion legislation and proxying how the cost of obtaining an abortion varies across states, this study assesses the implications of legislative changes on women?s contraceptive choices. Examining women by race/ethnicity, income, age, and religious affiliation, the results show that women respond to increased restrictions on abortion availability and cost but that the effects are very small. This study demonstrates that legislation restricting women?s access to abortions fails to promote greater use of more effective contraceptive methods, increasing the likelihood of unwanted births and illegal abortion procedures.JEL Classifications: D1, D81, I18, J13 ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]; Copyright of American Economist is the property of Sage Publications Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Instead, they advocate for coordinated approaches that address the unique circumstances of each offender. For 3 years, El Paso County ran a \"Pilot Program,\" which applied in-depth analytical tools to tailor court orders to each defendant. The program, to which offenders were randomly assigned, ran parallel to the county's \"one-size-fits-all\" program, providing a rare opportunity to assess the efficacy of each approach. We find the Pilot Program significantly increased compliance and reduced the likelihood of recidivism." ;

    schema:about "Psychological research has devoted much attention to how people judge and predict others. However, a full understanding of social perception necessitates incorporating the responses of the targets, who may have little interest in being predicted. The authors argue that whether people want to be predicted depends on the interpersonal context-in particular, competitive or cooperative ones. Study 1 used a unique behavioral measure and showed that competition participants, when asked to draw the flight path of a moth in a separate study, produced significantly more variable and significantly less predictable trajectories than did cooperation participants. Study 2 examined participants' self-assessments and showed that participants expecting a competitive interaction indicated that they were more difficult to predict, less willing to open up, and more willing to mislead. Together, the findings suggest that people are not always open to being predicted and that the form of these tendencies depends on features of the situation." ;

    schema:about "Settlement pattern data in the lower Salt River valley of central Arizona, near Phoenix, have led to different models of Hohokam political community organization during the early Classic period (ca. A.D. 1150-1300). The \"focal village\" model posits political communities centered on a single large village with monumental architecture surrounded by smaller settlements. The \"linear community\" model envisions an elongated arrangement integrating populations distributed along the routes of irrigation canals. Each model has implications for the nature of cooperation within and between settlement clusters and the degree to which large-scale irrigation management influenced the development of Hohokam, community organization. In this analysis, ceramic sourcing studies are used to outline networks of interaction to examine the different models. Our results provide some evidence for a crosscutting patchwork of geographically dispersed social groups which firs most comfortably within the linear community model." ;

Minimal thermodynamic data currently exist on the bulge size and sequence effects. Using thermal denaturation methods, thermodynamic properties of 1- to 5-nt adenine and guanine bulge loop constructs were examined in 10 mM MgCl2 or 1 M KCI. The Delta G(37)degrees loop parameters for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loops in RNA constructs were between 3.07 and 5.31 kcal/mol in 1 M KCl buffer. In 10 mM magnesium ions, the Delta Delta G degrees values relative to 1 M KCl were 0.47-2.06 kcal/mol more favorable for the RNA bulge loops. The Delta G(37)degrees loop parameters for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loops in DNA constructs were between 4.54 and 5.89 kcal/mol. Only 4- and 5-nt guanine constructs showed significant change in stability for the DNA constructs in magnesium ions. A linear correlation is seen between the size of the bulge loop and its stability. New prediction models are proposed for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loops in RNA and DNA in 1 M KCl. We show that a significant stabilization is seen for small bulge loops in RNA in the presence of magnesium ions. A prediction model is also proposed for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loop RNA constructs in 10 mM magnesium chloride." ;

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we observed that arrays of MS2 binding sites inhibit 5' to 3' degradation of the mRNA in yeast cells and lead to the accumulation of a 3' mRNA fragment containing the MS2 binding sites. This accumulation can be dependent on the binding of the MS2 stem loops (MS2-SL) by MS2 coat proteins (MCPs). Since such decay fragments can still bind MCP-GFP, the localization of such mRNA fragments can complicate the interpretation of the localization of full-length mRNA in vivo." ;

    schema:about "Atmosphere-surface exchange of mercury, although a critical component of its global cycle, is currently poorly constrained. Here we use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to interpret atmospheric Hg-0 (gaseous elemental mercury) data collected during the 2013 summer Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) aircraft campaign as well as ground-and ship-based observations in terms of their constraints on the atmosphere-surface exchange of Hg-0 over eastern North America. Model-observation comparison suggests that the Northwest Atlantic may be a net source of Hg-0, with high evasion fluxes in summer (our best sensitivity simulation shows an average oceanic Hg-0 flux of 3.3 ng m(-2) h(-1) over the Northwest Atlantic), while the terrestrial ecosystem in the summer of the eastern United States is likely a net sink of Hg-0 (our best sensitivity simulation shows an average terrestrial Hg-0 flux of -0.6 ng m(-2) h(-1) over the eastern United States). The inferred high Hg-0 fluxes from the Northwest Atlantic may result from high wet deposition fluxes of oxidized Hg, which are in turn related to high precipitation rates in this region. We also find that increasing simulated terrestrial fluxes of Hg-0 in spring compared to other seasons can better reproduce observed seasonal variability of Hg-0 concentration at ground-based sites in eastern North America." ;

    schema:about "The confluence of rising drug costs, more effective innovative medicines, and increasing public outrage have intensified the debate over pharmaceutical prices and access. We propose an alternative to the traditional patent system, providing direct tax credits to the pharmaceutical patent-holder in exchange for marginal cost pricing of the drug. This proposal is especially suited to the pharmaceutical industry, which produces a social good characterized by high fixed costs, high information and regulatory costs, and relatively low marginal costs of production. While preserving incentives to innovate, we posit that access and consumer surplus should increase through the elimination of monopoly prices.

    schema:about "Paradoxes abound in the music of Tannic Xenakis (1922-2001), a music almost paradigmatically \"difficult,\" recalcitrant to traditional modes of musical and aesthetic analysis, and yet shockingly direct in its aural richness and in its impact on listeners. In his theoretical writings, Xenakis makes repeated references to Presocratic philosophers-in particular, to Heraclitus and Parmenides-using these archaic texts to help make a case for his own \"stochastic music.\" Xenakis's interest here is in finding ways to integrate the stasis characteristic of Parmenides's account of the real with the constant flux of the real that Heraclitus describes. Xenakis goes further; however, to develop an account of listening as \"experimental\" on the basis of his distinctive reading of the Presocratic tradition. Thallein, a composition for large chamber ensemble, provides a vivid illustration and test case both for Xenakis's interpretation of the Presocratics and for his approach to listening as experiment." ;

    schema:about "In haploid cells of Ogataea (Hansenula) polymorpha an environmental signal, nitrogen starvation, induces a reversible change in the structure of a chromosome. This process, mating-type switching, inverts a 19-kb DNA region to place either MATa or MATa genes under centromeric repression of transcription, depending on the orientation of the region. Here, we investigated the genetic pathway that controls switching. We characterized the transcriptomes of haploid and diploid O. polymorpha by RNAseq in rich and nitrogen-deficient media, and found that there are no constitutively a-specific or a-specific genes other than the MAT genes themselves. We mapped a switching defect in a sibling species (O. parapolymorpha strain DL-1) by interspecies bulk segregant analysis to a frameshift in the transcription factor EFG1, which in Candida albicans regulates filamentous growth and white-opaque switching. Gene knockout, overexpression and ChIPseq experiments show that EFG1 regulates RME1, which in turn regulates STE12, to achieve mating-type switching. All three genes are necessary both for switching and for mating. Overexpression of RME1 or STE12 is sufficient to induce switching without a nitrogen depletion signal. The homologous recombination genes RAD51 and RAD17 are also necessary for switching. The pathway controlling switching in O. polymorpha shares no components with the regulation of HO in S. cerevisiae, which does not involve any environmental signal, but it shares some components with mating-type switching in Kluyveromyces lactis and with white-opaque phenotypic switching in C. albicans.

    schema:about "The B lymphotrophic ?-herpesvirus EBV is associated with a variety of lymphoid- and epithelial-derived malignancies, including B cell lymphomas in immunocompromised and immunosuppressed individuals. The primary oncogene of EBV, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to induce the autocrine growth factor, IL-10, in EBV-infected B cells, but the mechanisms underlying PI3K activation remain incompletely understood. Using small molecule inhibition and siRNA strategies in human B cell lines expressing a chimeric, signaling-inducible LMP1 protein, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)-LMP1, we show that NGFR-LMP1 utilizes Syk to activate PI3K/Akt signaling and induce IL-10 production. NGFR-LMP1 signaling induces phosphorylation of BLNK, a marker of Syk activation. Whereas Src kinases are often required for Syk activation, we show here that PI3K/Akt activation and autocrine IL-10 production by NGFR-LMP1 involves the Src family kinase Fyn. Finally, we demonstrate that NGFR-LMP1 induces phosphorylation of c-Cbl in a Syk- and Fyn-dependent fashion. Our results indicate that the EBV protein LMP1, which lacks the canonical ITAM required for Syk activation, can nevertheless activate Syk, and the Src kinase Fyn, resulting in downstream c-Cbl and PI3K/Akt activation. Fyn, Syk, and PI3K/Akt antagonists thus may present potential new therapeutic strategies that target the oncogene LMP1 for treatment of EBV+ B cell lymphomas.

    schema:about "The mental number line, with its left-to-right orientation of increasing numerical values, is often regarded as evidence for a unique connection between space and number. Yet left-to-right orientation has been shown to extend to other dimensions, consistent with a general magnitude system wherein different magnitudes share neural and conceptual resources. Such observations raise a fundamental, yet relatively unexplored, question about spatial-numerical associations: What is the nature of the information represented along the mental number line? Here we show that this information is not exclusive to number, simultaneously accommodating numerical and non-numerical magnitudes. Participants completed the classic SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes) task while sometimes wearing wrist weights. Weighting the left wrist?thereby linking less and more weight to right and left, respectively?worked against left-to-right orientation of number, leaving no behavioral trace of the mental number line. Our findings point to the dynamic integration of magnitude dimensions, with spatial organization instantiating representational currency (i.e., more/less relations) shared across magnitudes.

    schema:about "The addition of charcoal (or biochar) to soil has significant carbon sequestration and agronomic potential, making it important to determine how this potentially large anthropogenic carbon influx will alter ecosystem functions. We used column experiments to quantify how hydrologic and nutrient-retention characteristics of three soil materials differed with biochar amendment. We compared three homogeneous soil materials (sand, organic-rich topsoil, and clay-rich Hapludert) to provide a basic understanding of biochar-soil-water interactions. On average, biochar amendment decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) by 92% in sand and 67% in organic soil, but increased K by 328% in clay-rich soil. The change in K for sand was not predicted by the accompanying physical changes to the soil mixture; the sand-biochar mixture was less dense and more porous than sand without biochar. We propose two hydrologic pathways that are potential drivers for this behavior: one through the interstitial biochar-sand space and a second through pores within the biochar grains themselves. This second pathway adds to the porosity of the soil mixture; however, it likely does not add to the effective soil K due to its tortuosity and smaller pore size. Therefore, the addition of biochar can increase or decrease soil drainage, and suggests that any potential improvement of water delivery to plants is dependent on soil type, biochar amendment rate, and biochar properties. Changes in dissolved carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes also differed; with biochar increasing the C flux from organic-poor sand, decreasing it from organic-rich soils, and retaining small amounts of soil-derived N. The aromaticity of C lost from sand and clay increased, suggesting lost C was biochar-derived; though the loss accounts for only 0.05% of added biochar-C. Thus, the direction and magnitude of hydraulic, C, and N changes associated with biochar amendments are soil type (composition and particle size) dependent." ;

    schema:about "Core Goodeniaceae is a clade of similar to 330 species primarily distributed in Australia. Considerable variation in flower morphology exists within this group and we aim to use geometric morphometrics to characterize this variation across the two major subclades: Scaevola sensu lato (s. l.) and Goodenia s. l., the latter of which was hypothesized to exhibit greater variability in floral symmetry form. We test the hypothesis that floral morphological variation can be adequately characterized by our morphometric approach, and that discrete groups of floral symmetry morphologies exist, which broadly correlate with subjectively determined groups. From 335 images of 44 species in the Core Goodeniaceae, two principal components were computed that describe >98% of variation in all datasets. Increasing values of PC1 ventralize the dorsal petals (increasing the angle between them), whereas increasing values of PC2 primarily ventralize the lateral petals (decreasing the angle between them). Manipulation of these two morphological \"axes\" alone was sufficient to recreate any of the general floral symmetry patterns in the Core Goodeniaceae. Goodenia s. l. exhibits greater variance than Scaevola s. l. in PC1 and PC2, and has a significantly lower mean value for PC1. Clustering clearly separates fan-flowers (with dorsal petals at least 120 degrees separated) from the others, whereas the distinction between pseudo-radial and bilabiate clusters is less clear and may form a continuum rather than two distinct groups. Transitioning from the average fan-flower to the average non-fanflower is described almost exclusively by PC1, whereas PC2 partially describes the transition between bilabiate and pseudo-radial morphologies. Our geometric morphometric method accurately models Core Goodeniaceae floral symmetry diversity." ;

    schema:about "Here we present an examination of type IV pilus genes associated with competence and twitching in the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi (strain ADP1, BD413). We used bioinformatics to identify potential competence and twitching genes and their operons. We measured the competence and twitching phenotypes of the bioinformatically-identified genes. These results demonstrate that competence and twitching in A. baylyi both rely upon a core of the same type IV pilus proteins. The core includes the inner membrane assembly platform (PilC), a periplasmic assemblage connecting the inner membrane assembly platform to the secretin (ComM), a secretin (ComQ) and its associated pilotin (PilF) that assists with secretin assembly and localization, both cytoplasmic pilus retraction ATPases (PilU, PilT), and pilins (ComP, ComB, PilX). Proteins not needed for both competence and twitching are instead found to specialize in either of the two traits. The pilins are varied in their specialization with some required for either competence (FimT) and others for twitching (ComE). The protein that transports DNA across the inner membrane (ComA) specializes in competence, while signal transduction proteins (PilG, PilS, and PilR) specialize in twitching. Taken together our results suggest that the function of accessory proteins should not be based on homology alone. In addition the results suggest that in A. baylyi the mechanisms of natural transformation and twitching are mediated by the same set of core Type IV pilus proteins with distinct specialized proteins required for each phenotype. Finally, since competence requires multiple pilins as well as both pilus retraction motors PilU and PilT, this suggests that A. baylyi employs a pilus in natural transformation.

    schema:about "Women are underrepresented in a number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Limited diversity in the development of the STEM workforce has negative implications for scientific innovation, creativity, and social relevance. The current study reports the first-year results of the PROmoting Geoscience Research, Education, and SuccesS (PROGRESS) program, a novel theory-driven informal mentoring program aimed at supporting first- and second-year female STEM majors. Using a prospective, longitudinal, multi-site (i.e., 7 universities in Colorado/Wyoming Front Range &amp; Carolinas), propensity score matched design, we compare mentoring and persistence outcomes for women in and out of PROGRESS (N = 116). Women in PROGRESS attended an off-site weekend workshop and gained access to a network of volunteer female scientific mentors from on- and off-campus (i.e., university faculty, graduate students, and outside scientific professionals). The results indicate that women in PROGRESS had larger networks of developmental mentoring relationships and were more likely to be mentored by faculty members and peers than matched controls. Mentoring support from a faculty member benefited early-undergraduate women by strengthening their scientific identity and their interest in earth and environmental science career pathways. Further, support from a faculty mentor had a positive indirect impact on women's scientific persistence intentions, through strengthened scientific identity development. These results imply that first- and second- year undergraduate women's mentoring support networks can be enhanced through provision of protÃ©gÃ© training and access to more senior women in the sciences willing to provide mentoring support.

    schema:about "The linear progression of time defines the very notion of the \"Modern\" as a discernible epoch along the continuum of a common understanding of the progression of time. To alter the relationship of the subject to the normative progression of time or, more radically, to alter temporality itself is to fracture the firmament of the Modern as both a discernible epoch and its existence as context for thinking. This paper is to examine avant garde jazz music and its abandonment of the fundamentals of western music, particularly meter, as a foray into the creation of a sonic representation of alternative modes of subjective relation to temporality. This art is further analyzed in relation to the conception of subjectivity provided by Ellison and Du Bois, and regarded as an attempt to create a revolutionary space of radical freedom for the radical \"Other\"." ;

    schema:about "According to Kierkegaard, love plays a foundational role in human existence. In Works of Love, he identifies love as 'the deepest ground' of existence and as 'the source of everything,' a 'passion of the emotions' that exerts its influence like a 'hidden spring,' flowing from a single source 'along many paths' and 'forming the heart' of each human being. In this paper, I explain how love can provide grounding and orientation in the ways that Kierkegaard claims it can. Love is manifested in different forms, all of which are subject to the imperative of loving thy neighbor as thyself: it permits us to realize our own individuality and to appreciate the distinct existence of other persons, thus enabling us to inhabit a meaningful world. Thus, at the same time, love enables us to be and also to know.

    schema:about "Warmth and competence are fundamental dimensions used to characterize people, animals, and even corporations. Based on observations from a preliminary survey (Study 1) on the impact of scandals on several brands, we predicted that an organization that caused a disaster would be judged more harshly if its warmth rather than competence reputation was called into question. Study 1 surveyed a nationally representative sample of American adults and results showed that not all scandals had the same consequences on the perception of warmth, competence, and on consumer attitudes. Study 2 suggested that framing the cause of a local environmental disaster in terms of low warmth resulted in harsher judgments toward the responsible organization than framing the cause related to incompetence. Study 3 found that a warmth frame for post-disaster cleanup was ineffective compared to a competence frame. These results suggested that warmth and competence shape perceivers' blame attribution following a corporate or organizational disaster." ;

    schema:about "The regulation of dendritic branching is critical for sensory reception, cell-cell communication within the nervous system, learning, memory, and behavior. Defects in dendrite morphology are associated with several neurologic disorders; thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern dendrite morphogenesis is important. Recent investigations of dendrite morphogenesis have highlighted the importance of gene regulation at the posttranscriptional level. Because RNA-binding proteins mediate many posttranscriptional mechanisms, we decided to investigate the extent to which conserved RNA-binding proteins contribute to dendrite morphogenesis across phyla. Here we identify a core set of RNA-binding proteins that are important for dendrite morphogenesis in the PVD multidendritic sensory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans. Homologs of each of these genes were previously identified as important in the Drosophila melanogaster dendritic arborization sensory neurons. Our results suggest that RNA processing, mRNA localization, mRNA stability, and translational control are all important mechanisms that contribute to dendrite morphogenesis, and we present a conserved set of RNA-binding proteins that regulate these processes in diverse animal species. Furthermore, homologs of these genes are expressed in the human brain, suggesting that these RNA-binding proteins are candidate regulators of dendrite development in humans." ;

    schema:about "Effective boundary mechanisms halt the spread of repressive histone methylation. In the fission yeast Schizosacchromyces pombe, two factors/elements required for boundary function have been described, the jmjC protein Epe1 and binding sites for the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC. Perplexingly, individual mutation of Epe1 or TFIIIC sites produces only mild boundary defects, and no other boundary factors have been identified. To approach these issues, we developed a synthetic reporter gene tool that uses a tethered Clr4 histone H3K9 methyltransferase and monitors the ability of a DNA element to block heterochromatin spread. The inverted repeat (IR) that flanks the mat2/3 silent mating-type cassette region demonstrates strong boundary activity compared to sequences that flank pericentromeric heterochromatic repeats. Rather than acting in the same inhibitory pathway, Epe1 and TFIIIC sites mediate boundary function of the IR via the two parallel and largely redundant pathways. We also use the system to demonstrate that HP1/Swi6 promotes boundary activity in addition to promoting silencing and acts in the same pathway as Epe1. Inhibition of heterochromatin spread at the endogenous IR element also requires either Epe1 or TFIIIC sites. Strikingly, mutation of both mechanisms results in growth inhibition that is associated with the spread of heterochromatin over many kilobases to the nearest essential gene and the near-complete silencing of several intervening euchromatic genes. The growth defect is reversed by deletion of clr4+, indicating that the redundant boundary mechanisms protect cells from intrinsic toxicity caused by the spread of heterochromatin." ;

    schema:about "Cell differentiation in yeast species is controlled by a reversible, programmed DNA-rearrangement process called mating-type switching. Switching is achieved by two functionally similar but structurally distinct processes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In both species, haploid cells possess one active and two silent copies of the mating-type locus (a three-cassette structure), the active locus is cleaved, and synthesis-dependent strand annealing is used to replace it with a copy of a silent locus encoding the opposite mating-type information. Each species has its own set of components responsible for regulating these processes. In this review, we summarize knowledge about the function and evolution of mating-type switching components in these species, including mechanisms of heterochromatin formation, MAT locus cleavage, donor bias, lineage tracking, and environmental regulation of switching. We compare switching in these well-studied species to others such as Kluyveromyces lactis and the methylotrophic yeasts Ogataea polymorpha and Komagataella phaffii. We focus on some key questions: Which cells switch mating type? What molecular apparatus is required for switching? Where did it come from? And what is the evolutionary purpose of switching?" ;

    schema:about "Of the eight subfamilies currently recognized in Bromeliaceae, Bromelioideae is perhaps the most poorly understood. Generic circumscriptions are unclear, and an exceptionally diverse morphology coupled with an unusually low rate of sequence divergence within Bromeliaceae has made it difficult to resolve phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily. Although recent molecular studies have begun elucidating relationships among species in Bromeliaceae, most have not sampled deeply and/or broadly across Bromelioideae. The purpose of this study was to conduct a phylogenetic analysis within subfamily Bromelioideae using three chloroplast DNA regions (matK, psbA-trnH, and trnL-trnF), with the inclusion of multiple species from a broad sampling of bromelioid genera. Ochagavia, Deinacanthon, Fascicularia, Bromelia and Fernseea diverged relatively early in the history of the subfamily, with the remaining taxa being placed in a large and poorly resolved eubromelioid clade. Bromelia and Cryptanthus were found to be monophyletic, while 13 other genera were polyphyletic. Aechmea, the most morphologically diverse genus within the subfamily, was highly polyphyletic, with species distributed among 12 different lineages, with little support for subgeneric circumscriptions." ;

    schema:about "Cambarus cryptodytes (Dougherty Plain Cave Crayfish) is an obligate inhabitant of groundwater habitats (i.e., a stygobiont) with troglomorphic adaptations in the Floridan aquifer system of southwestern Georgia and adjacent Florida panhandle, particularly in the Dougherty Plain and Marianna Lowlands. Documented occurrences of Dougherty Plain Cave Crayfish are spatially distributed as 2 primary clusters separated by a region where few caves and springs have been documented; however, the paucity of humanly accessible karst features in this intermediate region has inhibited investigation of the species' distribution. To work around this constraint, we employed bottle traps to sample for Dougherty Plain Cave Crayfish and other groundwater fauna in 18 groundwater-monitoring wells that access the Floridan aquifer system in 10 counties in southwestern Georgia. We captured 32 Dougherty Plain Cave Crayfish in 9 wells in 8 counties between September 2014 and August 2015. We detected crayfish at depths ranging from 17.9 m to 40.6 m, and established new county records for Early, Miller, Mitchell, and Seminole counties in Georgia, increasing the number of occurrences in Georgia from 8 to 17 sites. In addition, a new US Geological Survey (USGS) Hydrologic Unit Code 8 (HUC8) watershed record was established for the Spring Creek watershed. These new records fill in the distribution gap between the 2 previously known clusters in Georgia and Jackson County, FL. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that deployment of bottle traps in groundwater-monitoring wells can be an effective approach to presence-absence surveys of stygobionts, especially in areas where surface access to groundwater is limited." ;

Chronologies of the male's two nests, which were 510m apart, were separated by nearly 2 weeks. Each brood initially consisted of three owlets, similar to the mean brood size in monogamous pairs. The male delivered considerably fewer prey to the secondary nest, compared with prey-delivery rates at nests of monogamous males during the nestling period. Evidence suggested that all owlets fledged front the primary brood, but only one fledged front the secondary brood. We were uncertain of the cause of polygyny, but a possible explanation is the Hayman Fire shifted the operational sex ratio of the owls in favor of females. The extent of polygyny in Flammulated Owls may be limited by costs to the reproductive success of secondary females." ;

    schema:about "We took advantage of a high-density seismic array deployed coincident with US Array to study small-magnitude seismicity patterns in northern Wyoming. We detected and located a total of 89 earthquakes ranging in magnitude from -0.5 to 2.4 during the six-month period of April to September 2010. Most events were located shallower than 25 km in the crust, with a few events as deep as 39 km and one very deep earthquake below the Moho, at 63 km. We also detected and recorded 1563 mining explosions in the area. We computed focal mechanism solutions for 14 earthquakes and observed dominantly normal faulting. Stress inversions obtained from these focal mechanisms show extension oriented similar to N20 degrees E that matches borehole breakout data collected in the area. Though wastewater injection wells were active in the region, we see no evidence of induced seismicity in this catalog. The seismicity pattern shows earthquakes occurring beneath areas of high topography in the Bighorn and Owl Creek Mountain ranges. This may indicate a preference to slip on pre-existing weaknesses created during mountain building. The absence of earthquakes between 39 and 63 km depths represents an aseismic zone in the lower crust that may indicate a rheological change between brittle and ductile behavior in the crust, and a strong mantle capable of brittle failure.

    schema:about "The availability of almost 180 cosmogenic-radionuclide (CRN) surface-exposure ages from moraine boulders and glacially polished bedrock surfaces makes possible an assessment of the timing and character of the local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) and subsequent deglaciation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. A review of glacial chronologies and numerical modeling results indicates that although glaciers across Colorado responded broadly synchronously, apparent differences in the timing and magnitude of glacier retreat following the LLGM suggest that spatially variable regional forcing, possibly precipitation related, played a role in glacier behavior along with more spatially uniform hemispheric or global forcing. Glaciers in the five ranges examined reached their greatest LLGM extents before similar to 19.5 ka and abandoned their outermost LLGM moraines between similar to 23.5 and 19.5 ka. Detailed deglaciation chronologies are available for glaciers in four of the ranges. In the Sawatch Range and Sangre de Cristo Mountains, glaciers were near their LLGM extents at 17-16 ka, before retreating rapidly. In the San Juan Mountains and the Front Range, glaciers may have begun their post-LLGM recession earlier, although early deglaciation is indicated by only a few ages on polished bedrock that potentially contains pre-LLGM CRN inheritance, and thus may be too old. Regardless of the timing of the onset of deglaciation, the equilibrium-line rise associated with deglaciation was earlier and significantly larger in the San Juan Mountains than elsewhere in Colorado. This suggests that the San Juan Mountains, located well to the southwest of the other ranges, may have experienced enhanced precipitation during the LLGM, as did areas farther to the south and west, while LLGM conditions may have been drier in the northern and eastern Colorado ranges. A breakdown in this pattern after the LLGM, with precipitation decreasing in the south and west and increasing in the north and east, may have led to the range-to-range differences evident across Colorado. Deglaciation was nearly complete in all four ranges by 15-13 ka. While some proxy records indicate a later Younger Dryas-age cooling in the Colorado mountains, there is not clear moraine evidence of glacier readvance at that time." ;

    schema:about "This paper investigates if NFL teams maximize profits with respect to ticket price. We modify Ferguson et al.'s (1991) NHL paper as it pertains to the NFL. A profit function incorporating variable revenue and cost factors such as gate receipts and player expenses is employed. A systems model is used as the estimation procedure to identify the determinants of ticket prices for NFL franchises. The model implies a Kuhn-Tucker based cross equation parameter restriction that results from attendance capacity constraints. Results from the regression are then used in conjunction with other data to numerically test the first order necessary profit maximization conditions. The results indicate that over 80% of NFL teams set ticket prices in a manner consistent with gate receipt and profit maximization." ;

    schema:about "The stratigraphic record of shallow-water shoreline paleoenvironments is characterized by significant facies heterogeneity and laterally discontinuous stratal geometries. In contrast, we investigate a uniquely extensive and microstratigraphically spatially uniform interval of upper Famennian (Upper Devonian) marginal marine strata in the Rocky Mountains. This transgressive deposit (< 5 m thick) rests on a depositional sequence boundary, and is composed of a thin, discontinuous basal transgressive sandstone bed, two thin fossiliferous shale beds, and several meters of oncolite-bearing carbonate wackestone. The lower shale is a consistently thin (similar to 0.1 m) bed with a fossil fauna of spinicaudatans (clam shrimp or conchostracans), which are extant, bivalved, chitinous, benthic crustaceans that live in fresh to brackish water, in ephemeral ponds, estuaries, and other shoreline settings. Isotopic data for the oncolitic unit record deposition in an epicontinental seaway with restricted circulation and locally brackish conditions. Sulfur isotope data may also reflect short-term changes in redox conditions, consistent with our interpretation of temporary hypoxia during deposition of the spinicaudatan bed, based on its faunal assemblages. The remarkably large areal extent (similar to 1600 km north to south, and similar to 1000 km east to west) of this uniformly thin interval with marginal marine fauna is one of the most unusual paleoecological events of the latest Devonian in Laurentia. It is considered an artifact of exceptional depositional processes including passive transgression (i.e., little or no wave or tidal ravinement) along with rapid opportunistic takeover of habitats during transgression. The radiation, possibly associated with temporary hypoxia, was aided by the spinicaudatan reproductive strategy of numerous offspring, high growth rate, and rapid reproduction." ;

    schema:about "There has been growing interest within the economics discipline in the role of equity concerns in the distribution of resources. This paper presents empirical evidence from controlled laboratory experiments where third-party decision makers allocate resources between two individuals. The experimental results indicate that subjects view a wide range of different allocations as the fair distribution of resources. However, regression analysis indicates that both treatment effects and a few demographic variables explain some of this variation in fairness concepts. Most significantly, decision makers rewarded subjects who earned their favorable positions, and the gender of the decision maker was an important predictor of the allocation chosen.

    schema:about "Floods and droughts and their effects on Hohokam canal systems and irrigation agriculture play a prominent role in many cultural-historical interpretations of the Hohokam trajectory in the lower Salt River valley (modern-day Phoenix, AriZona metropolitan area). Catastrophic floods and associated geomorphic stream channel changes may have contributed to settlement and population changes and the substantial depopulation of the lower Salt River valley ca. A.D. 1450 or later In this study, archaeological data on Hohokam domestic architecture is used to infer changes in prehistoric population growth rates from ca. A.D. 775 through 1450 in the most thoroughly documented canal system in the Salt River valley. Changes in growth rates are compared to the retrodictions of annual streamflow discharge volumes derived from tree-ring records. Contrary to expectations, population growth rates increased as the frequency, magnitude, and duration of inferred flooding, drought, and variability increased. These results challenge existing assumptions regarding the relationship among floods and droughts, conditions for irrigation agriculture, and population change in the lower Salt River valley." ;

    schema:about "This essay makes the case that one of the most significant errors in aesthetic theory is its failure to account for art as a creative act that emerges from the temporal flow of lived experience. Drawing on John Dewey's aesthetics and contemporary poetics, it articulates a view of creative action in terms of temporal experience. It begins by showing why time must be considered central to aesthetic theory, drawing a connection between time and what Dewey calls the logic of qualitative thought. It then distinguishes between time as a temporal ordering and time as a temporal quality of creative action. Finally, it argues that creative action is only possible because it is a temporally emergent process that is qualitatively experienced. As a result of placing temporality at its core, aesthetic theory shifts from a concern with the products of the art world to the practices of creative action." ;

It figures centrally in Krull's classical construction of valued fields with pre-described value groups, and plays a crucial role in our new short proof of the Ohm-Jaffard-Kaplansky theorem on Bezout domains with given lattice-ordered abelian groups. Furthermore, Eisenstein's criterion on the irreducibility of polynomials as well as Chao's beautiful extension of Eisenstein's criterion over arbitrary domains, in particular over Dedekind domains, are also obvious consequences of Gauss' lemma. We conclude with a new result which provides a Gauss' lemma for Hermite rings." ;

    schema:about "Populations of Impatiens capensis can differentiate across a range of soil moisture conditions. Differences in the plasticity of drought response at both the physiological and morphological level have been documented in populations across the North American range of this species. Impatiens populations tend to utilize whichever drought response mechanism will be most helpful in ensuring their survival and persistence in their particular environment. Here, we examine whether populations from a range of moisture environments exhibit tolerance/avoidance strategies in early life-history and whether maternal effects are important to seedling stress responses. Populations from Pennsylvania across a range of three moisture conditions all responded to maternal drought by decreasing stomatal conductance in seedlings; this maternal drought response was ephemeral and only observed during the first few weeks of growth. Moreover, abscisic acid content covaried with this conductance plasticity for two of the three populations. For the population with the greatest amount of soil moisture, abscisic acid sensitivity seemed to be more important for maternal drought response." ;

Drawing on Locke's canonical discussion in the Second Treatise, influential Anglo-American political theorists also suggest that the establishment of modern constitutional states required outlawing resistance practices. A francophone perspective, however, raises a problem for such generalizations about modern Western political philosophy and practice: the French \"resistance\" differs in meaning from the English \"resistance\" in important ways. Reconstructing the histories of the cognate concepts, I show that \"resistance\" emerged out of feminized discourses concerning moral conscience and that, as a result, excluding resistance from politics seems implausible, a conclusion that sheds light on the discussion of resistance in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. The article closes with the suggestion that, following the Second World War, French understandings of \"resistance\" may have influenced American politics and thought in unrecognized ways." ;

    schema:about "We investigated lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of 22 male and 46 female adult Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) in Colorado from 1981-2003. Sexual differences in LRS were at least partially attributable to incomplete breeding histories of females, due to females having a higher estimated emigration rate from the study area than males. The mean number of lifetime breeding attempts for males was 3.4 ?l 0.6 (SE; range = 1-12), and for females it was 1.9 ?l 0.3 (range = 1-8). Adjusted for emigration beyond the study area, the estimated mean number of lifetime breeding attempts was 3.6 for males and 2.5 for females. The mean number of lifetime successful breeding attempts (fledging at least one owlet) was similar to lifetime breeding attempts for each sex, reflecting the fact that 84% (85 of 101) of all breeding attempts were successful. Breeding lifespan was correlated with lifetime reproduction for both sexes. Males tended nests that produced 6.9 ?l 1.2 fledglings over 4.3 ?l 0.8 yr, while females produced 4.0 ?l 0.6 fledglings over 2.0 ?l 0.3 yr; adjusted for emigration beyond the study area, males tended nests that produced 7.2 fledglings over 4.5 yr, while females produced 5.2 fledglings over 2.6 yr. Relatively few individuals of each sex produced most of the offspring, as 18% of females and 24% of males produced 50% of total owlets. Our finding that relatively few adults accounted for most offspring appears to be associated with habitat quality in territories. Flammulated Owls tend to have a life-history strategy similar to larger raptors by having a relatively low annual reproductive rate and a relatively long lifespan." ;

    schema:about "This article draws on Lacanian theory in order to analyse the role of technology in the constitution of posthuman subjects. It does so by focussing firstly on those aspects of Lacan's teachings that engage with science and technology, particularly the concept of the 'alethosphere' developed in Seminar XVII, which refers to an environment of gadgets that plug directly into human desire. The article then goes on to apply this notion of the 'alethosphere' to a key technological, cultural and also political example: the interactive, touch-screen electoral maps made popular during the 2008 American election. Through a close analysis of one use of such maps during a CNN broadcast, the author demonstrates both the essential meaninglessness of this technology, and the support it nonetheless provides to the search for meaning, in the form of a unified American national subject emerging consensually from the spectacle of the process of democracy.

    schema:about "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human.-herpesvirus that establishes latency and lifelong infection in host B cells while achieving a balance with the host immune response. When the immune system is perturbed through immunosuppression or immunodeficiency, however, these latently infected B cells can give rise to aggressive B cell lymphomas. Natural killer (NK) cells are regarded as critical in the early immune response to viral infection, but their role in controlling expansion of infected B cells is not understood. Here, we report that NK cells from healthy human donors display increased killing of autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) harboring latent EBV compared to primary B cells. Coculture of NK cells with autologous EBV+ LCL identifies an NK cell population that produces IFN gamma and mobilizes the cytotoxic granule protein CD107a. Multi-parameter flow cytometry and Boolean analysis reveal that these functional cells are enriched for expression of the NK cell receptor NKG2A. Further, NKG2A(+) NK cells more efficiently lyse autologous LCL than do NKG2A(-) NK cells. More specifically, NKG2A(+) 2B4(+) CD16(-)CD57(-)NKG2C(-)NKG2D(+) cells constitute the predominant NK cell population that responds to latently infected autologous EBV+ B cells. Thus, a subset of NK cells is enhanced for the ability to recognize and eliminate autologous, EBV-infected transformed cells, laying the groundwork for harnessing this subset for therapeutic use in EBV+ malignancies." ;

    schema:about "Williams syndrome (WS) is a unique neurodevelopmental disorder with a specific behavioral and cognitive profile, which includes hyperaffiliative behavior, poor social judgment, and lack of social inhibition. Here we examined the morphology of basal dendrites on pyramidal neurons in the cortex of two rare adult subjects with WS. Specifically, we examined two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) - the frontal pole (Brodmann area 10) and the orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann area 11) - and three areas in the motor, sensory, and visual cortex (BA 4, BA 3-1-2, BA 18). The findings suggest that the morphology of basal dendrites on the pyramidal neurons is altered in the cortex of WS, with differences that were layer-specific, more prominent in PFC areas, and displayed an overall pattern of dendritic organization that differentiates WS from other disorders. In particular, and unlike what was expected based on typically developing brains, basal dendrites in the two PFC areas did not display longer and more branched dendrites compared to motor, sensory and visual areas. Moreover, dendritic branching, dendritic length, and the number of dendritic spines differed little within PFC and between the central executive region (BA 10) and BA 11 that is part of the orbitofrontal region involved into emotional processing. In contrast, the relationship between the degree of neuronal branching in supra-versus infra-granular layers was spared in WS. Although this study utilized tissue held in formalin for a prolonged period of time and the number of neurons available for analysis was limited, our findings indicate that WS cortex, similar to that in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, Fragile X, and idiopathic autism, has altered morphology of basal dendrites on pyramidal neurons, which appears more prominent in selected areas of the PFC. Results were examined from developmental perspectives and discussed in the context of other neurodevelopmental disorders. We have proposed hypotheses for further investigations of morphological changes on basal dendrites in WS, a syndrome of particular interest given its unique social and cognitive phenotype." ;

    schema:about "Within the last century, the floristic composition of riparian communities in the Southwest has drastically changed following introduction of the exotic tree Tamarix ramosissima. In an attempt to control Tamarix populations, the tamarisk leaf beetle ( Diorhabda carinulata) has been utilized as a biological control agent. Three years of data collection at our study sites along Fountain Creek (Fountain, CO) allowed us to characterize the response of Tamarix to invasion by the biological control agent. In analyzing data collected before, during, and after the beetle invasion, we observed a significant effect of foliar herbivory on Tamarix physiology and life history strategy. Associations between flower number and functional traits changed before, during, and after the beetle invasion. Before the invasion, reproductively fit individuals exhibited high stomatal conductance and used relatively more water. During and after the invasion, fit plants had higher foliar chlorophyll content, but conductance was not significantly correlated with fecundity. Tamarix responded to defoliation by increasing water use, which may have been an attempt to sustain photosynthate allocation to reproductive structures. Therefore, the leaf beetle may increase the water use of Tamarix during the growing season.

Al analizar los datos obtenidos antes, durante y despuÃ©s de la invasiÃ³n del escarabajo, observamos un efecto significativo de la herbivorÃ­a foliar en la fisiologÃ­a y la estrategia de historia de vida de Tamarix. Las asociaciones entre el nÃºmero de flores y los rasgos funcionales se modificaron antes, durante y despuÃ©s de la invasiÃ³n de escarabajos. Antes de la invasiÃ³n, los individuos reproductivamente aptos mostraban en los estomas una conductancia elevada y utilizaban relativamente mÃ¡s agua. Durante y despuÃ©s de la invasiÃ³n, las plantas sanas mostraron un mayor contenido de clorofila foliar, pero la conductancia no se correlacionÃ³ significativamente con la fecundidad. El Tamarix respondiÃ³ a la defoliaciÃ³n mediante el aumento en el uso de agua, lo que pudo ser un intento para mantener la asignaciÃ³n de fotosintatos a las estructuras reproductivas. Por lo tanto, el escarabajo puede aumentar el uso del agua de Tamarix durante su estaciÃ³n de crecimiento.

    schema:about "Puya (Bromeliaceae), a large genus of terrestrial bromeliads found throughout a range of elevations in the Andes and central Chile, is of great systematic, evolutionary, and biogeographical interest. This first molecular phylogenetic study of Puya and related bromeliads employs matK, trnS-trnG, rps16, and PHYC sequences. Chloroplast DNA, nuclear DNA, and combined DNA data all place Puya closest to subfamily Bromelioideae. Nuclear and combined data support Puya as monophyletic, and the two subgenera are nonmonophyletic. All data indicate that the Chilean species of Puya are early diverging within the genus, consistent with Chilean genera as the first-diverging members of subfamily Bromelioideae. Central Chile is identified as a key region for understanding the biogeographical history of Bromeliaceae, as is true with other South American plant groups. A complicated history involving early chloroplast capture and later secondary hybridization and/or introgression is seen in Chilean lineages. These events help explain the occurrence of sterile inflorescence tips, floral color and shape, and leaf indument. The ecological radiation of Puya appears coincident with the final, recent rise of the Andes and subsequent high-elevation habitat diversification. Additionally, geographical distribution, rather than moisture or elevational adaptations, correlates to species relationships. Evolution of CAM photosynthesis has occurred multiple times." ;

    schema:about ". Premise : Bromeliaceae form a large, ecologically diverse family of angiosperms native to the New World. We use a bromeliad phylogeny based on eight plastid regions to analyze relationships within the family, test a new, eight-subfamily classification, infer the chronology of bromeliad evolution and invasion of different regions, and provide the basis for future analyses of trait evolution and rates of diversification. . Methods : We employed maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian approaches to analyze 9341 aligned bases for four outgroups and 90 bromeliad species representing 46 of 58 described genera. We calibrate the resulting phylogeny against time using penalized likelihood applied to a monocot-wide tree based on plastid ndhF sequences and use it to analyze patterns of geographic spread using parsimony, Bayesian inference, and the program S-DIVA. . Results : Bromeliad subfamilies are related to each other as follows: (Brocchinioideae, (Lindmanioideae, (Tillandsioideae, (Hechtioideae, (Navioideae, (Pitcairnioideae, (Puyoideae, Bromelioideae))))))). Bromeliads arose in the Guayana Shield ca. 100 million years ago (Ma), spread centrifugally in the New World beginning ca. 16-13 Ma, and dispersed to West Africa ca. 9.3 Ma. Modern lineages began to diverge from each other roughly 19 Ma. . Conclusions : Nearly two-thirds of extant bromeliads belong to two large radiations: the core tillandsioids, originating in the Andes ca. 14.2 Ma, and the Brazilian Shield bromelioids, originating in the Serro do Mar and adjacent regions ca. 9.1 Ma." ;

    schema:about "The evolution of the inflorescence head in Asteraceae is important in the diversification of this largest angiosperm family. The aggregation of heads into higher-order capitulescences (secondary heads or syncephalia) is considered evolutionarily advanced. The genera Moscharia, Nassauvia, Polyachyrus, and Triptilion of the subtribe Nassauviinae (Mutisieae) have syncephalia with differing degrees of capitula condensation. ITS and plastid trnL-trnF regions were analyzed separately and together using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood to examine the evolution of syncephalia in the Nassauviinae. The four genera displaying syncephalia do not form a clade minus taxa without syncephalia, indicating that secondary heads in Nassauviinae have either convergently evolved twice in the subtribe (or, very unlikely) once with multiple reversions. Strong support was obtained for a sister relationship between Leucheria (without syncephalium) and Polyachyrus, and both sister to Moscharia. Nassauvia and Triptilion form a distinct clade but are sister to other genera, Perezia and Panphalea, without syncephalium. Previous hypotheses postulated the evolution from simple to more complex secondary heads. We show that the ancestor of Moscharia, Polyachyrus, and Leucheria, in a more and habitat, had a complex type of secondary head, and loss of complexity occurred in response to a shift from and to mesic conditions." ;

    schema:about "We used a novel task: a blackjack game that naturally involves mental summation of numerical values to investigate the role of attention in the mental number line (MNL) and to provide insight into the ecological validity of this representational format. By analyzing the spatial position of participants' spontaneous, task-irrelevant eye movements, we avoided some of the limitations of previous research on the MNL, in which the findings could be attributed to task-specific factors such as the use of overt spatial cues. In two experiments, we found that eye movements along the horizontal axis reflected the overall numerical value of participants' hands, with smaller-value hands eliciting fixations toward the left of the screen and larger-value hands eliciting fixations toward the right. This pattern held even when controlling for the number of cards in the hand and the value of the card most recently dealt, suggesting that the effects were driven by mental summation of values, not merely by the processing of serial order or individual numbers. Vertical eye movements, in contrast, reflected hand value less reliably. In showing that spontaneous eye movements along the horizontal axis track the magnitude of internally computed sums in an ecologically relevant task, our findings provide evidence for a dynamic MNL that supports magnitude-driven shifts of attention and that may be recruited during everyday forms of numerical reasoning.

    schema:about "The spatial relation of support has been regarded as universally privileged in nonlinguistic cognition and immune to the influence of language. English, but not Korean, obligatorily distinguishes support from nonsupport via basic spatial terms. Despite this linguistic difference, previous research suggests that English and Korean speakers show comparable nonlinguistic sensitivity to the support/nonsupport distinction. Here, using a paradigm previously found to elicit cross-language differences in color discrimination, we provide evidence for a difference in sensitivity to support/nonsupport between native English speakers and native Korean speakers who were late English learners and tested in a context that privileged Korean. Whereas the former group showed categorical perception (CP) when discriminating spatial scenes capturing the support/nonsupport distinction, the latter did not. An additional group of native Korean speakers -- relatively early English learners tested in an English-salient context -- patterned with the native English speakers in showing CP for support/nonsupport. These findings suggest that obligatory marking of support/nonsupport in one's native language can affect nonlinguistic sensitivity to this distinction, contra earlier findings, but that such sensitivity may also depend on aspects of language background and the immediate linguistic context.

    schema:about "For sufficiently wide orbital separations a, the two members of a stellar binary evolve independently. This implies that in a wide double white dwarf (DWD), the more massive WD should always be produced first, when its more massive progenitor ends its main sequence (MS) life, and should therefore be older and cooler than its companion. The bound, wide DWD HS 2220+2146 ( au) does not conform to this picture: the more massive WD is the younger and hotter of the pair. We show that this discrepancy is unlikely to be due to past mass-transfer phases or to the presence of an unresolved companion. Instead, we propose that HS 2220+2146 formed through a new wide DWD evolutionary channel involving the merger of the inner binary in a hierarchical triple system. The resulting blue straggler and its wide companion then evolved independently, forming the WD pair seen today. Although we cannot rule out other scenarios, the most likely formation channel has the inner binary merging while both stars are still on the MS. This provides us with the tantalizing possibility that Kozaiâ€“Lidov oscillations may have played a role in the inner binaryâ€™s merger. Gaia may uncover hundreds more wide DWDs, leading to the identification of other systems like HS 2220+2146. There are already indications that other WD systems may have been formed through different, but related, hierarchical triple evolutionary scenarios. Characterizing these populations may allow for thorough testing of the efficiency with which Kozaiâ€“Lidov oscillations induce stellar mergers.

    schema:about "Following the discovery of the T8 subdwarf WISE. J200520.38+542433.9 (Wolf 1130C), which has a proper motion in common with a binary (Wolf 1130AB) consisting of an M subdwarf and a white dwarf, we set out to learn more about the old binary in the system. We find that the A and B components of Wolf 1130 are tidally locked, which is revealed by the coherence of more than a year of V-band photometry phase-folded to the derived orbital period of 0.4967 days. Forty new high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer provide radial velocities and a projected rotational velocity (v sin i) of 14.7 +/- 0.7 km s(-1) for the M subdwarf. In tandem with a Gaia parallax-derived radius and verified tidal locking, we calculate an inclination of i = 29 degrees +/- 2 degrees. From the single-lined orbital solution and the inclination we derive an absolute mass for the unseen primary (1.24(-0.15)(+0.19) M-circle dot). Its non-detection between 0.2 and 2.5 mu m implies that it is an old (>3.7 Gyr) and cool (T-eff 100 times the tertiary mass and the survival of the system through the common-envelope phase, where similar to 80% of the system mass was lost, is remarkable. Our analysis of Wolf 1130 allows us to infer its formation and evolutionary history, which has unique implications for understanding low-mass star and brown dwarf formation around intermediate-mass stars." ;

    schema:about "People everywhere laugh at their political leaders, not only to vent their outrage at ineptness or corruption in government, but also to express a basic instinct for independence from authority. The way we laugh at our political leaders reveals both our humanness and our conflicting expectations for leadership. This essay examines how and why citizens laugh at their leaders (especially American politicians), and what this tells us about the challenges of political leadership. The functions of political humor are analysed. The role of snark, or snide sarcasm, is described as a parallel culture to the life of politics and leadership. Rich political humor should leave us laughing, curious, and perhaps unsettled, yet not giving up on politics.

    schema:about "We collected mercury observations as part of the Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) aircraft campaign over the southeastern US between 1 June and 15 July 2013. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to interpret these observations and place new constraints on bromine radical initiated mercury oxidation chemistry in the free troposphere. We find that the model reproduces the observed mean concentration of total atmospheric mercury (THg) (observations: 1.49 +/- 0.16 ngm(-3), model: 1.51 +/- 0.08 ngm(-3)), as well as the vertical profile of THg. The majority (65 %) of observations of oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) were below the instrument's detection limit (detection limit per flight: 58-228 pgm(-3)), consistent with model-calculated Hg(II) concentrations of 0-196 pgm(-3). However, for observations above the detection limit we find that modeled Hg(II) concentrations are a factor of 3 too low (observations: 212 +/- 112 pgm-3, model: 67 +/- 44 pgm(-3)). The high-est Hg(II) concentrations, 300-680 pgm(-3), were observed in dry (RH < 35 %) and clean air masses during two flights over Texas at 5-7 km altitude and off the North Carolina coast at 1-3 km. The GEOS-Chem model, back trajectories and observed chemical tracers for these air masses indicate subsidence and transport from the upper and middle troposphere of the subtropical anticyclones, where fast oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) to Hg(II) and lack of Hg(II) removal lead to efficient accumulation of Hg(II). We hypothesize that the most likely explanation for the model bias is a systematic underestimate of the Hg(0) + Br reaction rate. We find that sensitivity simulations with tripled bromine radical concentrations or a faster oxidation rate constant for Hg(0) + Br, result in 1.5-2 times higher modeled Hg(II) concentrations and improved agreement with the observations. The modeled tropospheric lifetime of Hg(0) against oxidation to Hg(II) decreases from 5 months in the base simulation to 2.8-1.2 months in our sensitivity simulations. In order to maintain the modeled global burden of THg, we need to increase the in-cloud reduction of Hg(II), thus leading to faster chemical cycling between Hg(0) and Hg(II). Observations and model results for the NOMADSS campaign suggest that the subtropical anticyclones are significant global sources of Hg(II)." ;

In this paper, we describe a workshop model we have developed to facilitate communication, enriching and enlightening those immediately involved and can be successfully implemented as part of any outreach activity, whether the scientific/technical or educational community initiates it. The workshop model is composed of preworkshop, workshop, and postworkshop elements that strategically scaffold the participants' experience through extended cross-community breakout and networking time. This model has enabled deeper understanding in each community of the other's needs, and in many cases has resulted in a concrete outcome in the form of an online Earth Exploration Toolbook chapter that can be used effectively in educational contexts beyond the workshop participants.

    schema:about "Access to geoscience data has been difficult for many educators. Understanding what educators want in terms of data has been equally difficult for scientists. From 2004 to 2009, we conducted annual workshops that brought together scientists, data providers, data analysis tool specialists, educators, and curriculum developers to better understand data use, access, and user-community needs. All users desired more access to data that provide an opportunity to conduct queries, as well as visual/graphical displays on geoscience data without the barriers presented by specialized data formats or software knowledge. Presented here is a framework for examining data access from a workflow perspective, a redefinition of data not as products but as learning opportunities, and finally, results from a Data Use Survey collected during six workshops that indicate a preference for easy-to-obtain data that allow users to graph, map, and recognize patterns using educationally familiar tools (e.g., Excel and Google Earth)." ;

    schema:about "Discussions of the concept of authenticity often fail to define the conditions of an appropriate emotional orientation toward the world. With a more solid philosophical understanding of emotion, it should be possible to define more precisely the necessary conditions of emotional authenticity. Against this background, I interpret Kierkegaard's Either/Or as a narrative text that suggests a moral psychology of emotion that points toward the development of a better way of thinking about the ethics of authenticity. In the process, I also engage with the positions of other philosophers, both \"existential\" and \"analytic.\" The upshot of my argument is that a cognitive phenomenology of emotion can flesh out the ideal of truthfulness as a virtue of character, while forcing moral philosophers to question whether authenticity should be understood as an achievement of the will rather than as a matter of affective receptivity." ;

    schema:about "Biopharmaceutical research and development is overwhelmingly focused in the U.S. because here it is incentivized and encouraged through a robust intellectual property rights protection environment. Across the board, the United States provides the most comprehensive, effective intellectual property rights protections for biopharmaceuticals. As a result, the industry locates here, researches here and thrives here. With an acknowledgement of the importance of intellectual property rights as well as the wider benefits of biopharmaceutical research and development, it's tremendously disappointing that the recently negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Trade Agreement fails to deliver sufficient IP protection for biologics. This article explores the importance of a rigorous intellectual property environment for the biopharmaceutical industry through an examination of the importance of data exclusivity provisions. Such protection is critical as the number, complexity and cost of clinical trials increases. Technology inevitably evolves faster than the legal architecture that surrounds it. As technology evolves, making the development of new biologic vaccines and therapies possible, society's commitment to incentivize innovation and protect it must be enshrined in the intellectual property protections of agreements such as the TPP.

    schema:about "Combining calibrated hydrophone measurements with vessel location data from the Automatic Identification System, we estimate underwater sound pressure levels for 1,582 unique ships that transited the core critical habitat of the endangered Southern Resident killer whales during 28 months between march, 2011, and octoher, 2011 Median received spectrum levels of noise from 2,809 isolated transits are elevated relative to median background levels not only at low frequencies (20-30 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz from 100 to 1,000 Hz), but also at high frequencies (5-13 dB from 10 000 t 96,000 Hz) frequencies used by odontocetes. Broadband received levels (11.5-40,000 Hz) near the shoreline in Haro Strait (WA, USA) for the entire ship population were 110 +/- 7 dB mu Pa-2 on average. Assuming near-spberieal spreading based on a tranSm1SS1On loss expenment we compute mean broadband source levels for the ship population of 173 + 7 dB re 1 tiPa 1 m without accounting for frequency-dependent absorption. Mean ship speed was 73 + m/s 14.1 + 3.9 knots). Most ship classes show a linear relationship between source level and speed with a slope near +2 dB per m/s (+1 dB/knot). Spectrum, 1/12-octave, and 1/3-octave source levels for the whole population have median values that are comparable to previous measurements and models at most frequencies, but for select studies may be relatively low below 200 Hz and high above 20,000 Hz. Median source spectrum levels peak near 50 Hz for all 12 ship classes, have a maximum of 159 dB re 1 it mu Pa-2/Hz @ 1 m for container ships, and vary between classes. Below 200 Hz, the class-specific median spectrum levels bifurcate with large commercial ships grouping as higher power noise sources. Within all ship classes spectrum levels vary more at low frequencies than at high frequencies, and the degree of variability is almost halved for classes that have smaller speed standard deviations. This is the first study to present source spectra for populations of different ship classes operating in coastal habitats, including at higher frequencies used by killer whales for both communication and echolocation." ;

    schema:about "Here we report the results of fine resolution Y chromosomal analyses (Y-SNP and Y-STR) of 267 Bantu-speaking males from three populations located in the southeast region of Africa. In an effort to determine the relative Y chromosomal affinities of these three genotyped populations, the findings are interpreted in the context of 74 geographically and ethnically targeted African reference populations representing four major ethno-linguistic groups (Afro-Asiatic, Niger Kordofanin, Khoisan and Pygmoid). In this investigation, we detected a general similarity in the Y chromosome lineages among the geographically dispersed Bantu-speaking populations suggesting a shared heritage and the shallow time depth of the Bantu Expansion. Also, micro-variations in the Bantu Y chromosomal composition across the continent highlight location-specific gene flow patterns with non-Bantu-speaking populations (Khoisan, Pygmy, Afro-Asiatic). Our Y chromosomal results also indicate that the three Bantu-speaking Southeast populations genotyped exhibit unique gene flow patterns involving Eurasian populations but fail to reveal a prevailing genetic affinity to East or Central African Bantu-speaking groups. In addition, the Y-SNP data underscores a longitudinal partitioning in sub-Sahara Africa of two R1b1 subgroups, R1b1-P25* (west) and R1b1a2-M269 (east). No evidence was observed linking the B2a haplogroup detected in the genotyped Southeast African Bantu-speaking populations to gene flow from contemporary Khoisan groups." ;

    schema:about "P-type macroporous gallium phosphide (GaP) photoelectrodes have been prepared by anodic etching of an undoped, intrinsically n-type GaP(100) wafer and followed by drive-in doping with Zn from conformal ZnO films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Specifically, 30 nm ALD ZnO films were coated on GaP macroporous films and then annealed at T = 650 ©‚?'C for various times to diffuse Zn in GaP. Under 100 mW cm©Ø?€?“©‚?ø white light illumination, the resulting Zn-doped macroporous GaP consistently exhibit strong cathodic photocurrent when measured in aqueous electrolyte containing methyl viologen. Wavelength-dependent photoresponse measurements of the Zn-doped macroporous GaP revealed enhanced collection efficiency at wavelengths longer than 460 nm, indicating that the ALD doping step rendered the entire material p-type and imparted the ability to sustain a strong internal electric field that preferentially drove photogenerated electrons to the GaP/electrolyte interface. Collectively, this work presents a doping strategy with a potentially high degree of controllability for high-aspect ratio III©Ø?€?“V materials, where the ZnO ALD film is a practical dopant source for Zn." ;

    schema:about "An electrochemical liquid–liquid–solid (ec-LLS) process that yields crystalline silicon at low temperature (80 °C) without any physical or chemical templating agent has been demonstrated. Electroreduction of dissolved SiCl4 in propylene carbonate using a liquid gallium [Ga(l)] pool as the working electrode consistently yielded crystalline Si. X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction data separately indicated that the as-deposited materials were crystalline with the expected patterns for a diamond cubic crystal structure. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies further revealed the as-deposited materials (i.e., with no annealing) to be faceted nanocrystals with diameters in excess of 500 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra further showed no evidence of any other species within the electrodeposited crystalline Si. Raman spectra separately showed that the electrodeposited films on the Ga(l) electrodes were not composed of amorphous carbon from solvent decomposition. The cumulative data support two primary contentions. First, a liquid-metal electrode can serve simultaneously as both a source of electrons for the heterogeneous reduction of dissolved Si precursor in the electrolyte (i.e., a conventional electrode) and a separate phase (i.e., a solvent) that promotes Si crystal growth. Second, ec-LLS is a process that can be exploited for direct production of crystalline Si at much lower temperatures than ever reported previously. The further prospect of ec-LLS as an electrochemical and non-energy-intensive route for preparing crystalline Si is discussed." ;

    schema:about "The substrate-overlayer approach has been used to acquire surface enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) during and after electrochemical atomic layer deposition (ECALD) of CdSe, CdTe, and CdS thin films. The collected data suggest that SERS measurements performed with off-resonance (i.e. far from the surface plasmonic wavelength of the underlying SERS substrate) laser excitation do not introduce perturbations to the ECALD processes. Spectra acquired in this way afford rapid insight on the quality of the semiconductor film during the course of an ECALD process. For example, SERS data are used to highlight ECALD conditions that yield crystalline CdSe and CdS films. In contrast, SERS measurements with short wavelength laser excitation show evidence of photoelectrochemical effects that were not germane to the intended ECALD process. Using the semiconductor films prepared by ECALD, the substrate-overlayer SERS approach also affords analysis of semiconductor surface adsorbates. Specifically, Raman spectra of benzenethiol adsorbed onto CdSe, CdTe, and CdS films are detailed. Spectral shifts in the vibronic features of adsorbate bonding suggest subtle differences in substrate-adsorbate interactions, highlighting the sensitivity of this methodology." ;

    schema:about "The US state of New Mexico shifted its management and legal treatment of water in the 20th century to a private property access right, weakening communal notions of water. This article explains how New Mexico has redefined and territorialized water rights as private property through the adjudication process and administrative governance rules. State adjudication of water rights disrupts horizontal social relations. The process also results in territorialization Â©Ã˜?â‚¬?â€œ not of fluid water per se Â©Ã˜?â‚¬?â€œ but of water users themselves. As water users have adjusted to this rescaling of governance, the state has found new ways to govern users vertically through water-crisis measures." ;

The depth and systematic character of Rousseau's thought was recognized almost immediately by thinkers such as Kant and Hegel, yet debate continues over the degree to which Rousseau's legacy is the result of poetic, literary, or rhetorical genius, rather than of philosophic rigor or profundity. The authors focus on Rousseau's genuine yet undervalued stature as a philosopher. This collection includes essays that develop some of the complex problems Rousseau treated so radically and profoundly, as well as essays on the vigorous debates he engaged in with thoughtful contemporaries and predecessors\"-- Provided by publisher; Includes bibliographical references and index; Introduction / Eve Grace and Christopher Kelly -- Part I.

    bf:Summary "\"When soldiers at Fort Carson were charged with a series of 14 murders, PTSD and other \"invisible wounds of war\" were thrown into the national spotlight. With these events as their starting point, Jean Scandlyn and Sarah Hautzinger argue for a new approach to combat stress and trauma, seeing them not just as individual medical pathologies but as fundamentally collective cultural phenomena. Their deep ethnographic research, including unusual access to affected soldiers at Fort Carson, also engaged an extended labyrinth of friends, family, communities, military culture, social services, bureaucracies, the media, and many other layers of society. Through this profound and moving book, they insist that invisible combat injuries are a social challenge demanding collective reconciliation with the post-9/11 wars\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "\"The central goal of this reader is to develop the capacity for critical thinking about key issues in foreign policy and to turn students into social scientists who can understand and critique complex phenomena. Use of this reader will save time for instructors who may not want to spend weeks researching the best new articles in each subject domain. It consists of five parts: Part One: Historical Perspectives and Part Two: Theory and Grand Strategy sets the tone of the reader, wherein students are exposed to basic tenets of U.S. diplomatic history, and international relations theory; Part Three: Institutions and Processes examines the role of institutions and processes, largely at the domestic level of analysis, in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy; Part Four: The U.S. and the World provides a collection of essays on U.S. foreign relations with key states and regions in the 21st century; and Part Five: New Domains examines salient new domains in U.S. foreign policy in the 21st century. The reader will compliment existing U.S. foreign policy texts. The majority of the chapters are from published articles (e.g. Foreign Policy, Foreign Affairs, etc.), although several chapters were commissioned directly for this volume\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "\"An exploration of how doctors and social scientists in Fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle France and Italy explained crime, vagrancy, perversion, insanity, neurosis and genius\"-- Provided by publisher; \"As the 19th century drew to a close, France and Italy experienced an explosion of crime, vagrancy, insanity, neurosis and sexual deviance. 'Misfits' in Fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle France and Italy examines how the raft of self-appointed experts that subsequently emerged tried to explain this aberrant behavior and the many consequences this had. Susan Ashley considers why these different phenomena were understood to be interchangeable versions of the same inborn defects. The book looks at why specialists in newly -minted disciplines in medicine and the social sciences, such as criminology, neurology and sexology, all claimed that biological flaws--some inherited and some arising from illness or trauma--made it impossible for these 'misfits' to adapt to modern life. Ashley then goes on to analyse the solutions these specialists proposed, often distinguishing between born deviants who belonged in asylums or prisons and 'accidental misfits' who deserved solidarity and social support through changes to laws relating to issues like poverty and unemployment. The study draws on a comprehensive examination of contemporary texts and features the work of leading authorities like Cesare Lombroso, Jean-Martin Charcot, and ThÃƒÂ©odule Ribot, as well as investigators less known now but influential at the time. The comparative aspect also interestingly shows that experts collaborated closely across national and disciplinary borders, employed similar methods and arrived at common conclusions. This is a valuable study for all social and cultural historians of France and Italy and anyone interested in knowing more about the history of medicine in modern Europe\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "\"One method of American territory expansion in the U.S.- Mexico borderlands was the denial of property rights to Mexican land owners. Many historical accounts overlook this colonial impact on Indigenous and Mexican peoples, and what existing studies do tackle this subject tend to privilege the male experience. In Archives of Dispossession, Karen Roybal recenters the focus of land dispossession on women, arguing that gender, sometimes more than race, dictated legal concepts of property ownership and individual autonomy. Drawing on a diverse source base - legal land records, personal letters, and literary works - Roybal reveals voices of Mexican women in the Southwest and how they fought against the erasure of their rights, both as women and as Indigenous landowners. Woven throughout Roybal's analysis are these women's testimonies - their stories focusing on inheritance, property rights, and sovereignty. Roybal positions these testimonios as an alternate archive that illustrates the myriad ways in which multiple layers of dispossession - and the changes of property ownership in Mexican law - affected the formation of Mexicana identity\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "This edited collection brings together a robust range of philosophers who offer theoretically and critically informed proposals regarding the aims, policies, and structures of the university. The collection fills a major gap in the landscape of higher education theory and practice while concurrently reviving a long and often forgotten discourse within the discipline of philosophy. It includes philosophers from across the globe representing disparate philosophical schools, as well as various career stages, statuses, and standpoints within the university. There is also a diversity in method, approach and style, which varies from personal narratives and case studies, to philosophical genealogies, to traditional philosophical essays, and to systematic theories. The collection can serve as a theoretical resource for critically minded administrators and faculty who wish to analyze and change policies and structures at their home institutions. It will introduce them to a wide range of possible educational imaginaries, as well as provide them with productive suggestions for pragmatic change on campuses.Ã‚Â"@en ;

    bf:Summary "Brazil is known as the most African country outside the continent of Africa, and the state of Bahia, in northeastern Brazil, has the largest concentration of African descendants in the country. Once known as the largest Catholic country in the world, in the last three decades the religious scene in Brazil has become increasingly more plural. As late as the 1970s, CandomblÃ© and other Afro-Brazilian religious practices were prohibited and persecuted by Brazihan authorities. Since the 1980s, however, many terreiros have achieved the status of a recognized religion by the Brazilian government, although CandomblÃ© continues to suffer religious prejudice and intolerance. The last three decades have also witnessed a boom among the Brazilian Protestant churches, especially among those of Pentecostal identity. Most Protestants in Bahia fail to recognize the need for any kind of dialogue with CandomblÃ©. Lacking, at times, even the most rudimentary knowledge of this African-Brazilian religion, and upholding a theology that demonizes all African religious expressions and their beliefs, most Bahian Protestants, known as EvangÃ©licos, have refrained from all contact with candomblecistas, save that of the evangelistic and proselytizing type. This paper represents an effort, from a Brazilian Protestant perspective, to reflect on this intolerance, the exclusivist theology that grounds it, and possible alternatives to it.

    bf:Summary "Neocortical development in humans is characterized by an extended period of synaptic proliferation that peaks in mid-childhood, with subsequent pruning through early adulthood, as well as relatively delayed maturation of neuronal arborization in the prefrontal cortex compared with sensorimotor areas. In macaque monkeys, cortical synaptogenesis peaks during early infancy and developmental changes in synapse density and dendritic spines occur synchronously across cortical regions. Thus, relatively prolonged synapse and neuronal maturation in humans might contribute to enhancement of social learning during development and transmission of cultural practices, including language. However, because macaques, which share a last common ancestor with humans ~25 million years ago, have served as the predominant comparative primate model in neurodevelopmental research, the paucity of data from more closely related great apes leaves unresolved when these evolutionary changes in the timing of cortical development became established in the human lineage. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and Golgi staining to characterize synaptic density and dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory (area 3b), primary motor (area 4), prestriate visual (area 18), and prefrontal (area 10) cortices of developing chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We found that synaptogenesis occurs synchronously across cortical areas, with a peak of synapse density during the juvenile period (3-5 years). Moreover, similar to findings in humans, dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal neurons developed later than sensorimotor areas. These results suggest that evolutionary changes to neocortical development promoting greater neuronal plasticity early in postnatal life preceded the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages.

    schema:about "Conventional wisdom suggests that leaders should conform to a style best suited for one's organization, or at least the best style for a particular role. Yet, this approach implies a unitary approach to leadership and assumes chameleon-like capabilities. (Conger 2004) Recent work on the power of authenticity (e.g., George, et al., 2007) and the persistence of personality make it seem unlikely that would-be leaders are sufficiently malleable to change his or her leadership style at will. Instead, we should expect leaders to gravitate toward the roles in which they can be most authentic. We demonstrate this expected, natural sorting by examining US military organizations using Thompson's (1967) division of responsibility and control within organizations. In particular, we apply Yukl's (2008) leadership dimensions and Gangestad and Snyder's (2000) self-monitoring scale to demonstrate that technical core and institutional level leaders rely on very different leadership styles. We then show that the need for authenticity drives different personalities into very different leadership roles." ;

    schema:about "Basement-cored uplifts are observed globally and remain an enigmatic feature of plate tectonics due to the fact that, in many cases, they occur distant from a plate boundary. The Laramide Bighorn Arch in Wyoming is an archetypal basement-involved foreland arch and provides an excellent setting for the investigation of such structures. Previous studies proposed diverse arch formation models; each of which predicts a unique crustal geometry. We use high-resolution crustal imaging from teleseismic P wave receiver functions to test these models. We obtained our data from 239 three-component seismometers deployed as part of the Bighorns Arch Seismic Experiment as well as coeval regional Transportable Array stations. A sequential, two-layer thickness V-P/V-S (H-) stacking algorithm constrains sediment and crustal structure. Receiver function Common Conversion Point stacking results in 2-D transect images across the arch. Our results define an upwarp of the crust beneath the central and northern arch that extends into the Powder River Basin, north-northeast of the arch. The lack of Moho-cutting faults or a Moho geometry mirroring the arch rules out most shortening models except a crustal detachment model where shortening was accomplished by fault-propagation folding on a thrust splay ramping off a midcrustal detachment fault. The mismatch between gentle, symmetric Moho and asymmetric Laramide arch geometries and their trends suggests a pre-Laramide origin for at least a part of the Moho high. This high, perhaps in combination with a lesser degree of Laramide lithospheric buckling, may have caused emergent Laramide thrusting and thus nucleated the Bighorn Arch. Our results suggest that midcrustal detachment can form basement-involved foreland arches and suggest the hypothesis that preexisting undulations in the Moho may have nucleated individual arches." ;

    schema:about "Previous research has shown that memory for the surface detail of coins is poor. One explanation might be that gross features, such as size, colour and edging, are more important than surface detail when discriminating among coins and hence are more memorable. In a 2 x 4 within-groups experiment, 33 participants visually identified coins in 128 coin pairs with surface detail present or obscured, and possibly one of three gross features also eliminated. While the presence of surface detail maintained very high accuracy, when only surface detail was eliminated and the other gross features were still present, participants' accuracy remained high. If surface detail and any gross feature were eliminated concomitantly, accuracy fell significantly. These findings indicate that both surface detail and gross features provide important information for coin discrimination in the real world, and that the gross features of a coin are not more important for visual discrimination than surface detail.

    schema:about "In the attempt to reconstruct the prehistory of Pacific and Indian Ocean populations, Taiwan's aborigines appear to be of particular interest. Linguistic and archeological evidence indicates that the dispersal of Austronesian speakers throughout the islands of Oceania and Southeast Asia may have originated from Taiwan about 5,000 years ago. The Ami are Taiwan's largest aboriginal group. Here, we report on six polymorphic point mutation loci in Ami individuals and compare allelic frequencies to worldwide populations. In order to examine the genetic characteristics and relationships of the Ami aborigines, we used the allelic frequency data to generate expected heterozygosities, power of discrimination values, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees, principal component maps, and centroid gene flow plots. These analyses argue for the genetic isolation and uniqueness of the Ami people. Data supportive of limited gene flow and/or small population size, as well as genetic similarities to Native Americans, were observed. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc." ;

    schema:about "Professors often expect students to have the skills that are necessary to participate in discussions. Students, on the other hand, have been trained to glean information from the lecture format; their prior experiences in discussions are likely to be limited to personal opinions on topics such as stem-cell research or evolution. Sudden changes in expectations are jarring and unwelcome at any stage of life but especially when it affects our performance. Thus, bringing any new pedagogy into the classroom has to come with proper preparation for both the students and the faculty. Here, I present my guidelines for bringing discussions into small classrooms. A great deal of structure and preparation are needed to make a discussion-based class successful. To teach using a discussion-based format requires creating pedagogical links to every aspect of the course. It requires changing not only what we teach but also what we value. Various components that are needed for a successful discussion-based course are outlined here." ;

    schema:about "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is marked by a prominent negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of 3-5 parts per thousand that has a characteristic rapid onset, stable body, and recovery to near pre-CIE isotopic composition. Although the CIE is the major criterion for global correlation of the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, spatial variations in the position and shape of the CIE have not been systematically evaluated. We measured carbon isotope ratios of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(org)) and pedogenic carbonate (delta C-13(carb)) at six PETM sections across a 16 km transect in the SE Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. Bed tracing and high-resolution floral and faunal biostratigraphy allowed correlation of the sections independent of chemostratigraphy. The onset of the CIE in bulk organic matter at all six sections occurs within a single laterally extensive geosol. The magnitude of the CIE varies from 2.1 to 3.8 parts per thousand. The absolute and relative stratigraphic thickness of the body of the CIE in bulk organic matter varies significantly across the field area and underrepresents the thickness of the PETM body by 30%-80%. The variations cannot be explained by basinal position and instead suggest that delta C-13(org) values were influenced by local factors such as reworking of older carbon. The stratigraphic thickness and shape of the CIE have been used to correlate sections, estimate timing of biotic and climatic changes relative to the presumed carbon isotope composition of the atmosphere, and calculate rates of environmental and biotic change. Localized controls on delta C-13(org) values place these inferences in question by influencing the apparent shape and duration of the CIE." ;

    schema:about "Diverging from the historical precedent of using a midpoint rule (k=?) to experimentally structure two-person bargaining under incomplete information, extreme values of k (k={0, 1}) are invoked in an asymmetric information environment endowing one player with exclusive price-setting power and the other player with veto-only power. Theoretical analysis suggests that regardless of who possesses an information advantage, expected profits for a seller (buyer) decrease (increase) in k. Yet, experimental results show that under conditions of dramatic information asymmetry, not only is the observed share of the surplus is much smaller than predicted for the player with price-setting power, but also the player with the information advantage is unable to garner a greater share of the surplus as has been consistently demonstrated in previous studies providing a boundary test of Daniel et al.'s Information Disparity Hypothesis (1998).

    schema:about "Many plant species exhibit variable and synchronized reproduction, or masting, but less is known of the spatial scale of synchrony, effects of climate, or differences between patterns of pollen and seed production. We monitored pollen and seed cone production for seven Pinus ponderosa populations (607 trees) separated by up to 28 km and 1,350 m in elevation in Boulder County, Colorado, USA for periods of 4-31 years for a mean per site of 8.7 years for pollen and 12.1 for seed cone production. We also analyzed climate data and a published dataset on 21 years of seed production for an eighth population (Manitou) 100 km away. Individual trees showed high inter-annual variation in reproduction. Synchrony was high within populations, but quickly became asynchronous among populations with a combination of increasing distance and elevational difference. Inter-annual variation in temperature and precipitation had differing influences on seed production for Boulder County and Manitou. We speculate that geographically variable effects of climate on reproduction arise from environmental heterogeneity and population genetic differentiation, which in turn result in localized synchrony. Although individual pines produce pollen and seed, only one-third of the covariation within trees was shared. As compared to seed cones, pollen had lower inter-annual variation at the level of the individual tree and was more synchronous. However, pollen and seed production were similar with respect to inter-annual variation at the population level, spatial scales of synchrony and associations with climate. Our results show that strong masting can occur at a localized scale, and that reproductive patterns can differ between pollen and seed cone production in a hermaphroditic plant." ;

    schema:about "Ascertaining the genetic relationships between Austronesian populations is paramount to understanding their dispersal throughout the islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The start of the Austronesian expansion has been dated to approximately 6,000 years ago, and from linguistic and archeological evidence, the origin of this dispersal may have been the island of Formosa. Consequently, the Taiwanese aboriginal populations and their phylogenetic relationship to the Austronesian-speaking groups from Madagascar at the occidental fringes of the expansion are of great interest. In this study, allelic frequencies from six polymorphic point mutation loci were assessed in the Austronesian-speaking populations of Madagascar, the Atayal aborigines of Formosa, and the general populations of Bali and Java. These allelic frequencies were compared and analyzed with the corresponding values from eight other worldwide populations from geographically targeted regions. The group from Madagascar is genetically distinct from their east-African neighbor from Zimbabwe. Our data also indicates that the Ami and the Atayal aborigines in the island of Taiwan, which occupy adjacent territories, differ sharply genetically. Genetic differences were also found between the populations of Bali and Java, belying their geographical proximity. Our results indicate that the east-African population from Madagascar phylogenetically segregates intermediate between mainland east-African and east-Asian groups, corroborating linguistic data indicating the Austronesian influence on this population.

    schema:about "Accurately measuring biodiversity is essential for successful conservation planning. Due to biodiversity's complexity, specific taxa are often chosen as indicators of patterns of diversity as a whole. Such taxa can include vegetation which can inform conservation decisions by demarcating land units for management strategies. For land units to be useful, they must be accurate spatial representations of the species assemblages present on the landscape. In this study, we determined whether land units classified by vegetative communities predicted the community structure of a diverse group of invertebrates-the ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Specifically, that (1) land units of the same classification contained similar carabid species assemblages and that (2) differences in species structure were correlated with variation in land unit characteristics, including canopy and ground cover, vegetation structure, tree density, leaf litter depth, and soil moisture. The study site, the Braidwood Dunes and Savanna Nature Preserve in Will County, Illinois is a mosaic of differing land units. Carabid beetles were sampled continuously with pitfall trapping for 1 year (excluding winter) from September 2011 to November 2011 and from March 2012 to September 2012. Land unit characteristics were measured in July 2012. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinated the land units by their carabid species assemblages into five ecologically meaningful clusters: disturbed, marsh, prairie, restoration, and savanna. The subset of land unit characteristics with the highest rank correlation with the NMDS ordination included soil moisture, leaf litter depth, percentage of canopy cover, and percentage of grass ground cover. Land units classified by vegetative communities effectively represented carabid species assemblages." ;

    schema:about "Internalists about reasons generally insist that if a putative reason, R, is to count as a genuine normative reason for a particular agent to do something, then R must make a rational connection to some desire or interest of the agent in question. If internalism is true, but moral reasons purport to apply to agents independently of the particular desires, interests, and commitments they have, then we may be forced to conclude that moral reasons are incoherent. Richard Joyce (2001) develops an argument along these lines. Against this view, I argue that we can make sense of moral reasons as reasons that apply to, and are capable of motivating, agents independently of their prior interests and desires. More specifically, I argue that moral agents, in virtue of their capacities for empathy and shared intentionality, are sensitive to reasons that do not directly link up with their pre-existing ends. In particular, they are sensitive to, and hence can be motivated by, reasons grounded in the desires, projects, commitments, concerns, and interests of others. Moral reasons are a subset of this class of reasons to which moral agents are sensitive. Thus, moral agents can be motivated by moral reasons, even where such reasons fail to link up to their own pre-existing ends." ;

Here, phytochrome loss-of-function mutants were grown in dry and moist conditions to examine the role of three photoreceptors (phyA, phyB, and phyE) in stomatal conductance (g (ST)) and abscisic acid (ABA) concentration. Overall, drought treatment plants had lower g (ST) than moist treatment plants. However, the wild-type Landsberg erecta line had a less pronounced conductance response to drought treatment than the phytochrome mutants, suggesting a role for phytochrome in suppressing drought tolerance. Phytochrome gene effects were potentially additive for g (ST); however, PHYB and PHYE effects were nonadditive for ABA concentration." ;

    schema:about "The Adjusted Winner mechanism for two-player bargaining has been theoretically shown to produce 'fair' (efficient and envy-free) outcomes (Brams and Taylor 1996). We study this claim experimentally in a bilateral bargaining game of incomplete information for two divisible goods using three information conditions. Results indicate that the Adjusted Winner mechanism can be quite effective in achieving both efficient, equitable and envy-free outcomes in an experimental setting but results vary greatly depending on the knowledge that each party has of the preferences of their bargaining partner. Under conditions of common knowledge, when players have competing preferences, their bilateral decisions converge toward efficient outcomes, yet only one-third can be classified as 'envy-free.' In an environment where there is more uncertainty about preferences, pronounced strategic bidding emerges yet the result is twice as many envy-fee outcomes with increased levels of efficiency. Despite the fact that players dramatically misrepresent their true valuation for objects when ordinal preferences are commonly known to be complementary, both efficiency and envy-freeness approach maximum levels.

    schema:about "The sealed-bid it-double auction mechanism for two-person bargaining under incomplete information can be extended by providing a bonus for both traders if, and only if, an agreement is reached. Brams and Kilgour (1996, Group Decision and Negotiation, 5,239-262) proved that there is a unique level of bonus, namely, half the difference between the buyer's bid and seller's ask, that induces the traders to bargain truthfully. Stein and Parco (2001, unpublished manuscript) extend the theoretical work to the case of partial bonus levels that reduce, but do not completely eliminate, misrepresentation of the reservation values. In the present study, we experimentally investigate the effects of providing different bonus values on the misrepresentation of the bargainers' reservation values. Our results show that implementation of a bonus has a significant impact on bargaining behavior but not nearly to the extent predicted by the equilibrium analysis. A reinforcement-based learning model originally proposed for the no bonus case accounts quite well for the results of all three experimental conditions.

    schema:about "Across cultures and historical time, menstruation has tended to be perceived as mysterious, dangerous and potentially contaminating. Most world religions place prohibitions on and prescribe codified purity rituals for menstruating women. We surveyed 340 religious and non-religious women from the Rocky Mountain West region of the United States regarding their attitudes and experiences of menstruation. We found that prescriptive religious women rated their periods as more bothersome, embarrassing, shameful, and endorsed more prohibitions, prescriptions and seclusion during menses compared to non-religious women. However, perhaps because their religions openly acknowledge menstruation, and their practice of rituals spotlights menstruation as a special time, religious women also identified a positive aspect of their menstrual cycles not shared by their non-religious counterparts. This was a heightened sense of community with other women. Further, women in committed relationships had more positive experiences of menstruation than single women, and this was especially true for women in prescriptive religions, despite a greater onus placed on them to observe menstrual rituals. This study complicates our understanding of how the practice of codified religious prohibitions and prescriptions around menstruation impacts women's experience." ;

The method of identifying homes for energy audits has evolved from responding to homeowner requests to a proactive approach aimed at targeting older low-income neighborhoods and working with existing neighborhood associations. Recent work on the Mill Street Neighborhood in Colorado Springs, Colorado is presented in which a sample of homes (N = 14) received thermal audits, complete with blower door tests and Energy-10 computer modeling. The results are tabulated, analyzed, and extrapolated over the entire 145 homes in the neighborhood. The normally distributed ACH (n) values and the skewed distributions of R (aver) values and building sizes are discussed. A method of identifying unusual occupant behavior, relative to the building quality, is presented where the Home Heating Index is compared to a Building Thermal Performance Index (R (aver)/ACH (n) ). Estimates from extrapolation of the data predict that an investment of $146,500 USD in retrofit materials will yield a total annual neighborhood savings in energy, utility costs and GHG emissions of 9.1 x 10(6) kBtu (9.6 x 10(9) kJ), $64,000 USD and 555 US tons (5.0 x 10(5) kg), respectively, providing a simple payback time of 2.3 years. This efficient method of neighborhood energy audits provides data that could support neighborhood renewal grant proposals to purchase materials for follow-up retrofits and supports municipal demand-side management programs." ;

    schema:about "The Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, USA constitutes a paradigm for reconciling contemporary human actions and geological heritage conservation. The Amphitheatre, built upon red beds of the east flank of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, was constructed in the late 1930s with close attention to and respect for the existing geological landform. The park surrounding the performance space is incorporated in the Mountains Park System together with the adjoining Dinosaur Ridge/Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark. Together, the Red Rocks Park and the Dinosaur Ridge provide access to an informative geological cross-section that exemplifies the geology of the Rocky Mountains, from the Precambrian crystalline basement to and across the Phanerozoic cover. Park visitors and concert goers may explore or encounter the transect along walks that are marked by geology information panels. The situation of the Amphitheatre performance space within the geological transect provides a powerful example of the coexistence of different values and multiple uses that may increase the heritage of the site. Settings like this that educate and increase civic awareness of locations of geological value are potentially positive for geoconservation." ;

    schema:about "A comparison has been made of oxygen isotope analyses of natural and synthetic phosphates using three methods in current use and Ag3PO4 as the analyte. Of these methods, conventional fluotination using BrF5 provides the most precise and accurate measurements and these analyses serve as the basis for comparison. Fluorination liberates 100% of the oxygen in Ag3PO4 and the isotopic composition of this oxygen can be readily normalized to accepted oxygen isotope ratios of international reference standards. The widely used method of high-temperature reaction with graphite in isolated silica tubes is also precise but requires calibration for scale compression resulting from a combination of factors including incomplete extraction of oxygen, reaction temperature, possible oxygen exchange with the silica tube and/or differences in the grain size of the graphite used. The recently developed method based on high-temperature carbon reduction and continuous flow mass spectrometric analysis of CO is relatively fast, requires little sample and provides 100% yields for oxygen. At the present time, this method is less precise than the other methods examined and requires calibration against standards on a run to run basis. Five phosphate reference standards with delta(18)O values ranging from -5.2 parts per thousand to 34.0 parts per thousand were prepared and packaged for distribution to active workers in the field. Analyses of these standards will allow normalization and calibration of results obtained using any available method of oxygen isotope analysis of phosphate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

    schema:about "We investigated the control of proliferation and differentiation in the larval Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite germ line through analysis of glp-1 and lag-2 mutants, cell ablations, and ultrastructural data. After the first several rounds of germ cell division, GLP-1, a receptor of the LIN-12/Notch family, governs germline proliferation. We analyzed the proximal proliferation (Pro) phenotype in glp-1(ar202) and found that initial meiosis was delayed and spatially mispositioned. This is due, at least in part, to a heightened response of the mutant GLP-1 receptor to multiple sources of the somatic ligand LAG-2, including the proximal somatic gonad. We investigated whether proximal LAG-2 affects germline proliferation in the wild type. Our results indicate that (1) LAG-2 is necessary for GLP-1-mediated germline proliferation and prevention of early meiosis, and (2) several distinct anatomical sources of LAG-2 in the larval somatic gonad functionally overlap to promote proliferation and prevent early meiosis. Ultrastructural studies suggest that mitosis is not restricted to areas of direct DTC-germ line contact and that the germ line shares a common cytoplasm in larval stages. We propose that downregulation of the GLP-1 signaling pathway in the proximal germ line at the time of meiotic onset is under tight temporal and spatial control.

    schema:about "The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set ambient air quality standards for the United States. Areas that violate these standards (usually large urban centers) are required to use cleaner-burning automotive fuels (oxygenated fuels or ï¿½oxyfuelsï¿½) during the winter months in some cases and year-round (reformulated gasoline) in the worst cases. Oxygenated fuels are the primary alternative fuel in use, however, cleaning-up our aggregate automobile emissions can be done through many different methods. Using a cross-section of data from the California emissions testing program this paper investigates the environmental benefits gained by the use of oxyfuels. It estimates the actual CO and HC emissions abatement due to the use of the oxyfuel. The results suggest the CO emissions reductions are lower than previously thought due to the differential impact of the fuel on different automobile vintages. Cars built since 1988 have no CO emissions benefits as a result of using oxyfuels. Oxyfuels are also found to have no systematic impact on HC emissions. The oxyfuel smog test results are then compared to emissionsï¿½ improvements resulting from emissions system repairs. Increased maintenance and repairs are found to be a much more cost-effective method for lowering CO and HC emissions than oxyfuels.

    schema:about "Monoterpenes are important defensive chemicals that may experience diversifying selection from diverse herbivore assemblages. It is thus important to understand what trade-offs exist in the naturally occurring variation in monoterpene profiles. We measured the absolute concentration (mg/mL) of nine monoterpenes in the xylem resin of ponderosa pine from two populations. The size of the total monoterpene pool exhibited continuous (unimodal) variation. alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and Delta-3-carene account for the bulk of this pool, and in both populations, these three monoterpenes show a discontinuous pattern of variation, such that each individual tree could be assigned to one of five characteristic chemotypes. Moreover, the absolute concentrations of these monoterpene fractions are negatively correlated across individuals in both populations, such that an increase in the concentration of any one is correlated with a decrease in the total pool of all the remaining monoterpenes. The use of absolute concentrations rather than relative amounts demonstrates that such correlations are not a statistical artifact of compositional data. Taken together, these observations suggest that while the size of the total monoterpene pool is constrained, and is likely influenced by many genes and environmental factors, naturally occurring variation in the allocation of this pool to competing monoterpene fractions is controlled by relatively few genes. Such allocational trade-offs may place a constraint on the response of populations to selection by multiple herbivore species (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

However, the further into the future these predictions are extended. the less reliable they become-entropy.

An experimental investigation of a three-person centipede game shows that the paradoxical results are strongly affected by the size of the stakes. When the number of players in the game is increased from two to three and the game is played for unusually high stakes with group composition being randomly changed from trial to trial, the paradox is considerably weakened as players approach equilibrium play with multiple iterations of the stage game. When the game is played with low stakes, there is no evidence for equilibrium play or learning across iterations of the stage game. An adaptive learning model that assumes updating of the individual probabilities of choice outperforms alternative static and dynamic models in accounting for the major results observed in the high-stake experiment.

    schema:about "The gut lumen of the arthropod detritivore provides hospitable and multifaceted environments for diverse assemblages of microbes. Many microbes, including trichomycetes fungi, bacteria, and archaea establish stable, adherent communities on the cuticular surface secreted by the hindgut epithelium. Regional differences in the surface topography within the hindgut of a given millipede are reflected in differing and diverse microbial assemblages. The spirostreptid millipede Cambala speobia is a detritivore found on the floors of Texas caves. This millipede species has a very circumscribed distribution in North America and a diet confined to the limited litter that accumulates on floors of these caves while the common julid millipede Cylindroiulus caeruleocinctus, an introduced European species, feeds on the diverse litter found in organic soils throughout North America. In both millipedes, the gut lumina are inhabited along their entire lengths by microbes, with the highest microbial densities in the hindguts. The anterior third of the hindgut with its distinctive six-fold symmetry is lined by cuticle having fine polarized scales, and the posterior-most third is lined by smooth cuticle. Trichomycetes only inhabit the anterior third of the hindgut, and scattered patches of filamentous bacteria along with their smaller adherent microbes occupy the posterior third. The densest populations of microbes inhabit the central region of the hindgut. Over the cuticular surface of this hindgut region, uniformly distributed indentations mark possible channels for nutrient and water exchange between the hindgut lumen and host hemolymph. Films of microbes are adherent to the cuticle that lines the hindgut while those microbes in the remainder of the gut (i.e., foregut + midgut) represent mostly unattached inhabitants.

    schema:about "Genetic bottlenecks can be deleterious to populations. In biological control, agent populations may be subject to severe bottlenecks during selection, importation and while in culture. The genetic variability of two collections of the water hyacinth biological control agent Eccritotarsus catarinensis Carvalho (Hemiptera: Miridae) was measured using Inter-simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) and mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences. The first collection (Brazilian) went through a bottleneck of a single gravid female, while the second collection (Peru) originated from 1000 individuals and has been maintained at a large size in culture. Two naturalised South African populations from the Brazilian collection were also sampled (Nseleni and Mbozambo). Polymorphism for ISSR was high in the Peruvian and two naturalised samples, but much less so in the Brazilian sample. The Peruvian population was shown to be highly differentiated from the Brazilian and its naturalised populations by high values of F-ST and Nei's genetic distance, as well as in a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) plot and an unrooted neighbour joining tree derived from Jaccard's coefficient of similarity. In addition, sequencing of the COI region of the mitochondrial DNA revealed only two haplotypes, one Brazilian and one Peruvian, with a 5.2% sequence divergence, suggesting that recombination and not mutation is the cause of most variation in the ISSR regions. The results suggest that substantial genetic variation may be retained or recovered after a bottleneck. This may mitigate deleterious effects that are a concern for the fate of biological control agents after release. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved." ;

The probes are ratiometric, reversible and protected from interaction with the cellular environment, a quality which is of benefit to the integrity of both the cell and the sensor functionalities.

    schema:about "Simulation models and theory prove that emission trading converges to market equilibrium. This paper sets out to test these results using experimental economics. Three experiments are conducted for the six largest carbon emitting industrialized regions. Two experiments use auctions, the first a single bid auction and the second a Walrasian auction. The third relies on bilateral, sequential trading. The paper finds that, in line with the standard theory, both auctions and bilateral, sequential trading capture a significant part (88% to 99%) of the potential cost savings of emission trading. As expected from trade theory, all experiments show that the market price converges (although not fully) to the market equilibrium price. In contrast to the theory, the results also suggest that not every country might gain from trading. In both the bilateral trading experiment and the Walrasian auction, one country actually is worse off with trade. In particular bilateral, sequential trading leads to a distribution of gains significantly different from the competitive market outcome. This is due to speculative behavior, imperfect foresight and market power. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: The annual US News and World Report (USNWR) Guide to America''s Best Colleges is much anticipated by both high-ability high school seniors and college and university administrators. In this paper, we use a decade of Colgate University Admitted Student Questionnaire surveys to estimate the influence of changes in a school''s USNWR rank on the probability of matriculation. We find that school choice is responsive to changes in rank, that the sensitivity to rank declines at lower ranks, and this sensitivity is independent of other objective measures of quality. The importance of the rankings can also be different for women, minorities, and the highest ability aided students. They have also gotten more important over time for aided students. Our results suggest that it is rational for college administrators to pay attention to their USNWR rank because it is an important factor in yielding accepted students.

    schema:about "Abstract: There is widespread concern, both in the private and public sectors, about perceived declines in U.S. college graduates in STEM fields. In our sample, the proportion of science majors has remained steady over the sample period; however, the number entering our college intending to major in STEM fields has fallen. In this paper we use administrative data from the graduating classes of 2001-2009, roughly 5000 graduates, from a northeastern liberal arts college to model the progression of students through STEM majors. The results suggest that absolute and sometimes relative grades are important, as is the intended major (as reported on the admissions application). AP credits are also strongly correlated to taking a first course, but diminish in the more selected samples. Simulations suggest that if science grade distributions were more like the college average, there would be roughly 2-4% more students progressing in STEM departments.

    schema:about "This paper uses data on roommates from two different selective institutions to investigate the effect of peers on first-year performance, with a specific focus on the underlying mechanism. We compare measures of academic ability across student sub-groups by race, income, and gender, and across institutions. Male, minority, and aided students are affected most strongly by their peers. The size and presence of peer effects are dependent on the ability measure used as well as the setting. Standardized estimates suggest ability measured by high school grades have roughly twice the effect of ability measured by SATs. We also test the use of a standardized measure of first-year performance and find more consistent evidence of peer effects across both schools. Our results provide an explanation for the mixed findings in the literature and suggest that the driving force behind peer effects lies in the transfer of general academic know-how rather than in the teaching of specific knowledge or social proximity.

    schema:about "Traditional mechanisms for public participation in environmental impact assessment under U.S. federal law have been criticized as ineffective and unable to resolve conflict. As these mechanisms are modified and new approaches developed, we argue that participation should be designed and evaluated not only on practical grounds of cost-effectiveness and efficiency, but also on ethical grounds based on democratic ideals. In this paper, we review and synthesize modern democratic theory to develop and justify four ethical principles for public participation: equal opportunity to participate, equal access to information, genuine deliberation, and shared commitment. We then explore several tensions that are inherent in applying these ethical principles to public participation in EIA. We next examine traditional NEPA processes and newer collaborative approaches in light of these principles. Finally, we explore the circumstances that argue for more in-depth participatory processes. While improved EIA participatory processes do not guarantee improved outcomes in environmental management, processes informed by these four ethical principles derived from democratic theory may lead to increased public engagement and satisfaction with govemment agency decisions.

    schema:about "During the Late Cretaceous, western North America was characterized by a close geographic association between the Sevier highlands and the Western Interior Seaway. In this paper, an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is used to simulate the impact of this geographic association on surface pressure, wind direction, and precipitation, and it is predicted that seasonal changes in these variables resulted in a strong monsoon along the eastern flank of the Sevier Highlands. Confirmation that these model simulations are accurate is provided by isotopic data from foreland basin sediments. In particular oxygen isotope records from different environments (large rivers, small streams and ponds) and proxies (unionid bivalve shells and paleosol carbonates) indicate that foreland basin streams were recharged by local precipitation with high oxygen isotope ratios while large trunk rivers were recharged by high-elevation precipitation. This hydrologic pattern is observed from Alberta to Utah and is consistent with east to west monsoonal air mass movements and associated seasonal rainfall. Recognition of a highland-driven monsoon has implication in regard to studies of fossil taphonomy, of water vapor transport, and of links between climate and mountain uplift and exhumation in this region.

    schema:about "As a deep time analog for today's rapidly warming Arctic region, early Eocene (52-53 Ma) rock on Ellesmere Island in Canada's High Arctic (similar to 79 degrees N.) preserves evidence of lush swamp forests inhabited by turtles, alligators, primates, tapirs, and hippo-like Coryphodon. Although the rich flora and fauna of the early Eocene Arctic imply warmer, wetter conditions than at present, the quantification of Eocene Arctic climate has been more elusive. By analyzing oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic phosphate from mammal, fish, and turtle fossils from a single locality on central Ellesmere Island, we infer early Eocene Arctic temperatures, including mean annual temperature (MAT) of similar to 8 degrees C, mean annual range in temperature of similar to 16.5-19 degrees C, warm month mean temperature of 19-20 degrees C, and cold month mean temperature of 0-3.5 degrees C. Our seasonal range in temperature is similar to the range in estimated MAT obtained using different proxies. In particular, relatively high estimates of early Eocene Arctic MAT and SST by others that are based upon the distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids in terrestrial soil bacteria and isoprenoid tetraether lipids in marine Crenarchaeota fall close to our warm month temperature, suggesting a bias towards summer values. From a paleontologic perspective, our temperature estimates verify that alligators and tortoises, by way of nearest living relative-based climatic inference, are viable paleoclimate proxies for mild, above-freezing year-round temperatures. Although for both of these reptilian groups, past temperature tolerances probably were greater than in living descendants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "From the Late Jurassic through the Cretaceous, collision between the North American and Farallon plates drove extensive thin-skinned thrusting and crustal shortening that resulted in substantial relief in the North American Cordillera. The elevation history of this region is tightly linked to the tectonic, climatic and landscape evolution of western North America but is not well constrained. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model with integrated oxygen isotope tracers (isoCAM3) to predict how isotope ratios of precipitation would change along the North American Cordillera as the mean elevation of orogenic highlands increased from 1200 m to 3975 m. With increases in mean elevation, highland temperatures fall, monsoonal circulation along the eastern front of the Cordillera is enhanced, and wet season (generally spring and summer) precipitation increases. Simulated oxygen isotopic ratios in that precipitation are compared to those obtained from geologic materials (e.g. fossil bivalves, authigenic minerals). Quantification of match between model and data-derived delta O-18 values suggests that during the Late Cretaceous, the best approximation of regional paleoelevation in western North America is a large orogen on the scale of the modern Andes Mountains with a mean elevation approaching 4000 m and a north-south extent of at least 15 of latitude.

    schema:about "Abstract: The Austronesian expansion has left its fingerprint throughout two thirds of the circumference of the globe reaching the island of Madagascar in East Africa to the west and Easter Island, off the coast of Chile, to the east. To date, several theories exist to explain the current genetic distribution of Austronesian populations, with the \"slow boat\" model being the most widely accepted, though other conjectures (i.e., the \"express train\" and \"entangled bank\" hypotheses) have also been widely discussed. In the current study, 158 Y chromosomes from the Polynesian archipelagos of Samoa and Tonga were typed using high resolution binary markers and compared to populations across Mainland East Asia, Taiwan, Island Southeast Asia, Melanesia and Polynesia in order to establish their patrilineal genetic relationships. Y-STR haplotypes on the C2 (M38), C2a (M208), O1a (M119), O3 (M122) and O3a2 (P201) backgrounds were utilized in an attempt to identify the differing sources of the current Y-chromosomal haplogroups present throughout Polynesia (of Melanesian and/or Asian descent). We find that, while haplogroups C2a, S and K3-P79 suggest a Melanesian component in 23%-42% of the Samoan and Tongan Y chromosomes, the majority of the paternal Polynesian gene pool exhibits ties to East Asia. In particular, the prominence of sub-haplogroup O3a2c* (P164), which has previously been observed at only minimal levels in Mainland East Asians (2.0-4.5%), in both Polynesians (ranging from 19% in Manua to 54% in Tonga) and Ami aborigines from Taiwan (37%) provides, for the first time, evidence for a genetic connection between the Polynesian populations and the Ami.

UAE, located at the southeastern most portion of the Arabian Peninsula, in the tri-continental crossroads connecting Africa, Europe and Asia, has been influenced by a number of human dispersal waves from a plethora of sources including the Paleolithic \"Out of Africa\" migrations, the exodus of Neolithic pastoral agriculturalists from the Fertile Crescent and Northern Africa, as well as more recent migrations from Asia and the Middle East. We found that despite the high levels of consanguinity that characterize UAE, this population is genetically highly heterogeneous. When compared to various world-wide biogeographical regions, the Arabian Peninsula exhibits the highest intra-population variance. Admixture analyses indicate that UAE and Bahrain uniquely in Arabia share 23.7% and 22.9%, respectively, of their DNA with Southwest Asian populations. Similar and complex Structure profiles are seen among Arabian Peninsula populations underscoring the high genetic diversity of the region. Although UAE shares a number of genetic characteristics in common with the rest of the populations in the Arabian Peninsula, it is unique in terms of its relative high Asian genetic component, likely the result of geographical proximity to Southwest Asia, west-bound waves of migration and socio-political ties with territories to the east.

    schema:about "Abstract: In the present study, for the first time, 293 Taiwanese aboriginal males from all nine major tribes (Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Rukai, Paiwan, Saisat, Puyuma, Tsou, Yami) were genotyped with 17 YSTR loci in a attend to reveal migrational patterns connected with the Austronesian expansion. We investigate the paternal genetic relationships of these Taiwanese aborigines to 42 Asia-Pacific reference populations, geographically selected to reflect various locations within the Austronesian domain. The Tsou and Puyuma tribes exhibit the lowest (0.1851) and the highest (0.5453) average total genetic diversity, respectively. Further, the fraction of unique haplotypes is also relatively high in the Puyuma (86.7%) and low in Tsou (33.3%) suggesting different demographic histories. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed several notable findings: 1) the Taiwan indigenous populations are highly diverse. In fact, the level of inter-population heterogeneity displayed by the Taiwanese aboriginal populations is close to that exhibited among all 51 Asia-Pacific populations examined; 2) the asymmetrical contribution of the Taiwanese aborigines to the Oceanic groups. Ami, Bunun and Saisiyat tribes exhibit the strongest paternal links to the Solomon and Polynesian island communities, whereas most of the remaining Taiwanese aboriginal groups are more genetically distant to these Oceanic inhabitants; 3) the present YSTR analyses does not reveal a strong paternal affinity of the nine Taiwanese tribes to their continental Asian neighbors. Overall, our current findings suggest that, perhaps, only a few of the tribes were involved in the migration out of Taiwan.

The mafic dykes exhibit a variety of relationships with host rocks in the field ranging from undeformed dykes with sharp contacts with host gneisses to dismembered dykes with commingled textures and numerous back-veins of leucosome intruded from host migmatitic gneisses suggestive of significant interaction with crustal rocks. New U-Pb ages for magmatic zircon in these rocks yield Cretaceous crystallization ages ranging from ca 113 Ma to ca 98 Ma for the mafic dykes and ca 100 Ma for the diorite pluton. These mafic intrusive rocks, which contain abundant hydrous minerals, are medium- to high-K-series calc-alkaline rocks with basic-intermediate compositions (47-59 wt.% SiO2 for the mafic dykes and 52-56 wt.% SiO2 for the diorite pluton). They have trace element patterns characterized by LILE enrichments and negative Nb anomalies indicating an origin from a hydrous mantle source metasomatized by slab-derived components. The samples without evidence of interaction with crustal rocks (11 of 14 samples), which are likely to better reflect the mantle source composition, have positive epsilon Sr-(100 (Ma)) values (+8.1 to +14.5) and negative to slightly positive epsilon Nd-(100 (Ma)) values (-1.6 to +2.5) consistent with derivation from an enriched mantle source. These eleven samples may be divided into two groups either characterized by higher LILE/HFSE ratios, less radiogenic epsilon Sr-(100 (Ma)) values and more radiogenic epsilon Nd-(100 (Ma)) values, or characterized by relatively lower LILE/HFSE ratios, more radiogenic epsilon Sr-(100 (Ma)) values and less radiogenic epsilon Nd-(100 (Ma)) values suggesting differences in the mantle source. The results of this study are consistent with the melting of a variably metasomatized sub-arc mantle source during a transition from a wrench to a transtensional tectonic setting, but are inconsistent with a mantle plume origin.

    schema:about "Annual growth of semiarid tree species is generally limited by a period of water deficit and this relationship can be reflected in interannual variation in tree-ring width of semiarid species such as Pinus edulis, a pinon pine that is widely distributed across the southwestern United States. Tree-ring width of P. edulis and other semiarid tree species is most frequently related to annual precipitation amount alone or to the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). But water deficit and associated variation in moisture can also be described using numerous other indices such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and a comparison of the performance of several indices that relate historical climate data to tree-ring variation in P. edulis is lacking. We compared abilities to predict radial tree-ring growth of P. edulis using five metrics of water availability: PDSI, two indices based on precipitation alone (total precipitation and SPI), and two indices that factor in temperature to determine water deficit (based on Walter climate diagrams that use monthly precipitation and temperature). Each metric was evaluated over three commonly used time periods (water year, calendar year, and June-August) using the limited available data from P. edulis sites in the southwestern USA where co-located tree-ring and weather data were available. Our results indicate that PDSI was the best predictor of P. edulis ring widths, regardless of time period, and provide a first comparative test of PDSI with SPI and Walter indices that. can be further tested as larger data sets become available.

    schema:about "A JS surface is a minimal graph over a polygonal domain that becomes infinite in magnitude at the domain boundary. Jenkins and Serrin characterized the existence of these minimal graphs in terms of the signs of the boundary values and the side-lengths of the polygon. For a convex polygon, there can be essentially only one JS surface, but a non-convex domain may admit several distinct JS surfaces. We consider two families of JS surfaces corresponding to different boundary values, namely JS(0) and JS(1), over domains in the form of regular stars. We give parameterizations for these surfaces as lifts of harmonic maps, and observe that all previously constructed JS surfaces have been of type JS(0). We give an example of a JS(1) surface that is a new complete embedded minimal surface generalizing Scherk's doubly periodic surface, and show also that the JS(0) surface over a regular convex 2n-gon is the limit of JS(1) surfaces over non-convex stars. Finally we consider the construction of other JS surfaces over stars that belong neither to JS(0) nor to JS(1). (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc." ;

    schema:about "We report the results of an experiment on two-stage contests with budget-constrained agents competing to win an exogenously determined prize. In stage 1, agents first compete within their own groups by expending resources, and then in stage 2 the winners of each group compete with one another to win the prize by expending additional resources subject to the budget constraint. Winners in each stage are determined by Tullock's proportional contest success function. We present the subgame perfect equilibrium solution for this model, derive predictions for our experiment, and then test them experimentally. In agreement with previous experimental research on single-stage contests, the equilibrium model is flatly rejected due to over-expenditure in stage 1. A descriptive model that extends the equilibrium solution by allowing for (1) non-pecuniary utility of winning and (2) misperception of the probability of winning better accounts for some, but not all, of the behavioral regularities. Taking an alternative approach, we then turn to an adaptive learning model that accounts for several features of the dynamics of play but still significantly underpredicts the stage 1 expenditures.

    schema:about "We report results from a simultaneous bilateral bargaining experiment with attention to the effects of a settlement bonus on strategic decision-making behavior. In instances with a sufficiently large settlement bonus, truthful revelation emerges as the dominant strategy. However previous work (Parco 8.2 Rapoport, 2004) has experimentally tested this \"Bonus Effect\" and found that although the presence of a settlement bonus improves efficiency, behavior falls drastically short of the normative predictions. This finding illustrates the persistent tendency of decision makers to bid strategically, i.e. shading their bids, even when truthful revelation is a strictly dominant strategy. Herein we investigate the influence of the framing of information and look for ways to nudge decision makers toward making better choices in these strategic environments. Additional results from an adaptive reinforcement-based learning model are discussed as they relate to a potential innate bias for strategic misrepresentation even when contrary to self-interest and collective-interest.

    schema:about "The Fosdick migmatite-granite complex in West Antarctica records evidence for crustal melting during two periods of tectonism along the East Gondwana margin. Initial high-temperature metamorphism in the Devonian-Carboniferous (M-1) was broadly contemporaneous with emplacement of calc-alkaline arc magmas during Pacific-style accretionary margin convergence. This event involved metamorphism of arc plutonic rocks soon after their emplacement and partial melting and migmatization of host metasedimentary rocks. Preservation of M-1 garnet-bearing assemblages and mineral equilibria modeling of the metasedimentary rock and calc-alkaline plutonic rock protolith compositions regionally exposed constrain conditions of M-1 metamorphism to 820-870 degrees C and 7.5-11.5 kbar. A second anatectic event during the Cretaceous (M-2) resulted in metamorphism of plutonic rocks and partial melting of fertile metasedimentary rocks that had remained at a high enough structural level to have been subsolidus during the first anatectic event, and a metamorphic overprint on now residual paragneisses characterized by the growth of M-2 cordierite after garnet, and after biotite + sillimanite. Mineral equilibria modeling of para- and orthogneiss compositions in the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex constrain conditions of M-2 metamorphism to 830-870 degrees C and 6-7.5 kbar. We use the results of mineral equilibria modeling to assess the constituents of the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex as melt sources and as domains of melt transfer and melt accumulation during the two anatectic events. Modeling the range of metasedimentary rock protolith compositions shows that similar to 4-25 vol.% melt was produced at the conditions of M-1 metamorphism, although most compositions would have been fertile enough to reach the melt connectivity transition (similar to 7 vol.%) leading to the development of a melt extraction pathway and subsequent melt loss. The preservation of peak-M-1 assemblages in the paragneiss is consistent with melt loss, and modeling based on a representative protolith composition indicates that a minimum of 70% of the total melt produced must have been extracted from the metasedimentary rock source. The intrusive plutonic rocks produce similar to 2-3 vol.% melt during the M-1 event. Although the plutonic rocks were not a significant melt source at the level exposed, granites derived from these rocks but sourced at a deeper crustal level accumulated within the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex during the M-1 event. The elevated geotherms in a magmatic arc environment allow the possibility that higher crustal levels in the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex remained subsolid us during the M-1 event, and could be fertile sources during the M-2 event. At peak M-2 conditions, these fertile metasedimentary rocks would produce similar to 5-30 vol.% melt, whereas the plutonic rocks were not likely a significant source of melt at this crustal depth. The residual paragneisses that underwent melting and melt loss during the M-1 event are estimated to produce similar to 12 vol.% additional melt during M-2. The mechanical anisotropy created by the residual gneisses likely produced a gradient in melt pressure. This gradient, together with shallow fabrics in the hosting gneisses, could have acted to focus M-2 melts derived from the fertile metasedimentary rocks into a horizontally-sheeted leucogranite complex. The accumulation of these melts would have lead to pronounced weakening of the crust, facilitating the exhumation of the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex during the transition from regional shortening during M-2 to regional extension at ca. 100 Ma.

    schema:about "Although the use of stable isotope data from vertebrate remains is becoming common for the Cenozoic, their application to Mesozoic environments has been rare, in part due to the perception that diagenesis has obfuscated all potential primary signal. In this paper, we illustrate how stable isotope data collected from dinosaur and other vertebrate remains can in fact be used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions during the Mesozoic. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were measured from tooth enamel of hadrosaur dinosaurs and from scales of freshwater fish that were collected from sites in the Two Medicine, Judith River, and Dinosaur Park Formations of Montana and Alberta. These formations represent a coastal to upland gradient along the western margin of the Late Cretaceous inland seaway. Isotopic comparisons among skeletal components and among taxa are used as evidence that primary paleoenvironmental information, as recorded by isotope data, is preserved in tooth enamel and freshwater fish scales. A comparison of carbon isotope ratios between hadrosaur tooth enamel and sedimentary organic matter indicates that these animals had a larger isotopic offset compared to bulk diet than modern mammals, and that all hadrosaurian isotope data are consistent with the existence of C(3)-only ecosystems. Higher and more variable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from animals occupying the coastal Judith River region are interpreted to reflect a range of freshwater to brackish water conditions and plants that were undergoing water stress. Lower and less variable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from the upland Two Medicine and intermediate Dinosaur Park areas are interpreted to reflect a gradual rainout of moisture from air masses moving inland and more uniform environmental conditions. Overall. these results indicate that stable isotopes from dinosaur and other vertebrate remains have the potential to expand our understanding of terrestrial environments and ecosystems during the Mesozoic.

    schema:about "Reproductive behaviors of early Eocene equids were likely different from their modern-day counterparts as a result of their small body size and warmer global temperatures. To better understand the paleoenvironment and ecology of these early horses, teeth of Protorohippus montanum jaws from a single stratigraphic locality in early Eocene sedimentary deposits of Wyoming were sampled for oxygen and carbon isotope analysis. These enamel data along with an inferred body mass of similar to 7.5 kg suggests that adult teeth formed over a matter of months, with the final tooth erupting at similar to 1.3 years of age. Thus, average isotopic values from each tooth likely represent environmental conditions from a single season. Results indicate two isotopic patterns. In the case of isotopic \"pattern A,\" the second forming molars (m/2s) have significantly lower isotopic ratios compared to other teeth within the jaw. This suggests the first forming molars (m/1s) formed during a cooling fall season, followed by formation of the m/2s during the cooler winter. In the case of isotopic \"pattern B,\" results suggest that m/1s formed during a warming spring season, while the m/2s formed during the following warmer summer season. Isotopic ratios of m/1s may represent an individual's birth season (or in utero season, depending on timing of initial formation), implying that early equids experienced at least two birth seasons per year. These results suggest that temperatures and reduced seasonality of the early Eocene played a strong role in early equid birth cycles. Lastly, the mean and variance in carbon and oxygen isotope ratios was not significantly different across tooth positions of all jaws when all individuals were grouped together, regardless of their pattern assignment. Such results indicate that isotopic data from fourth premolars, first molars, second molars, and third molars can be combined for purposes of temporal reconstructions of paleoclimate, thus increasing the potential sample sizes for these types of studies.

Using a combination of ethnographic and network data, this paper examines the social structure of artists on the island and finds that it contains elements of both support and hostility. The hostility is mostly engendered by the clique of neo-traditionalist intellectuals who, although of Cook Islands ancestry, have been raised and educated abroad and have returned to the islands bringing with them a new conception of indigenous culture, political power and rights. The particular network structure on the island, however, facilitates the constant interaction of this group with others so that both positive and negative ties remain constantly activated. Acting as scapegoats and prods to each other - as well as supportive members of an art world - the artists on the island have built a network structure which facilitates a hothouse innovative environment. This lends support to the further conclusion that creativity and innovation are enhanced by social structures surrounding the creators. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." ;

PEBBLEs allow for minimally intrusive sensing of ions in cellular environments due to their small size (20 to 600 nm in diameter) and protect the sensing elements (i.e. fluorescent dyes) by encapsulating them within an inert matrix. The selectivity and sensitivity of these nanosensors are comparable to those of macroscopic ion selective optodes, and electrodes, while the response time and absolute detection limit are significantly better. This paper discusses the principles guiding PEBBLE design including synthesis, characterization, diversification, the advantages and limitations of the sensors, cellular applications and future directions of PEBBLE research.

    schema:about "The Fosdick Mountains migmatite-granite complex in West Antarctica records episodes of crustal melting and plutonism in Devonian-Carboniferous time that acted to transform transitional crust, dominated by immature oceanic turbidites of the accretionary margin of East Gondwana, into stable continental crust. West Antarctica, New Zealand and Australia originated as contiguous parts of this margin, according to plate reconstructions, however, detailed correlations are uncertain due to a lack of isotopic and geochronological data. Our study of the mid-crustal exposures of the Fosdick range uses U-Pb SHRIMP zircon geochronology to examine the tectonic environment and timing for Paleozoic magmatism in West Antarctica, and to assess a correlation with the better known Lachlan Orogen of eastern Australia and Western Province of New Zealand. NNE-SSW to NE-SW contraction occurred in West Antarctica in early Paleozoic time, and is expressed by km-scale folds developed both in lower crustal metasedimentary migmatite gneisses of the Fosdick Mountains and in low greenschist-grade turbidite successions of the upper crust, present in neighboring ranges. The metasedimentary rocks and structures were intruded by calc-alkaline, I-type plutons attributed to arc magmatism along the convergent East Gondwana margin. Within the Fosdick Mountains, the intrusions form a layered plutonic complex at lower structural levels and discrete plutons at upper levels. Dilational structures that host anatectic granite overprint plutonic layering and migmatitic foliation. They exhibit systematic geometries indicative of NNE-SSW stretching, parallel to a first-generation mineral lineation. New U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages for granodiorite and porphyritic monzogranite plutons, and for leucogranites that occupy shear bands and other mesoscopic-scale structural sites, define an interval of 370 to 355 Ma for plutonism and migmatization. Paleozoic plutonism in West Antarctica postdates magmatism in the western Lachlan Orogen of Australia, but it coincides with that in the central part of the Lachlan Orogen and with the rapid main phase of emplacement of the Karamea Batholith of the Western Province, New Zealand. Emplaced within a 15 to 20 million year interval, the Paleozoic granitoids of the Fosdick Mountains are a product of subduction-related plutonism associated with high temperature metamorphism and crustal melting. The presence of anatectic granites within extensional structures is a possible indication of alternating strain states ('tectonic switching') in a supra-subduction zone setting characterized by thin crust and high heat flow along the Devonian-Carboniferous accretionary margin of East Gondwana.

    schema:about "Abstract: Interactions between the somatic gonad and the germ line influence the amplification, maintenance, and differentiation of germ cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the distal tip cell/germline interaction promotes a mitotic fate and/or inhibits meiosis through GLP-1/Notch signaling. However, GLP-1-mediated signaling alone is not sufficient for a wild-type level of germline proliferation. Here, we provide evidence that specific cells of the somatic gonadal sheath lineage influence amplification, differentiation, and the potential for tumorigenesis of the germ line. First, an interaction between the distal-most pair of sheath cells and the proliferation zone of the germ line is required for larval germline amplification. Second, we show that insufficient larval germline amplification retards gonad elongation and thus delays meiotic entry. Third, a more severe delay in meiotic entry, as is exhibited in certain mutant backgrounds, inappropriately juxtaposes undifferentiated germ cells with cells of the proximal sheath lineage, leading to the formation of a proximal germline tumor derived from undifferentiated germ cells. Tumors derived from dedifferentiated germ cells, however, respond to the proximal interaction differently depending on the mutant background. Our study underscores the importance of strict developmental coordination between neighboring tissues. We discuss these results in the context of mechanisms that may underlie tumorigenesis.

    schema:about "Abstract: Ribosome biogenesis is a cell-essential process that influences cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. How ribosome biogenesis impacts development, however, is poorly understood. Here, we establish a link between ribosome biogenesis and gonadogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans that affects germline proliferation and patterning. Previously, we determined that pro-1 (+)activity is required in the soma -- specifically, the sheath/spermatheca sublineage -- to promote normal proliferation and prevent germline tumor formation. Here, we report that PRO-1, like its yeast ortholog IPI3, influences rRNA processing. pro-1tumors are suppressed by mutations in ncl-1or lin-35/Rb, both of which elevate pre-rRNA levels. Thus, in this context, lin-35/Rbacts as a soma-autonomous germline tumor promoter. We further report the characterization of two additional genes identified for their germline tumor phenotype, pro-2and pro-3, and find that they, too, encode orthologs of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis in yeast (NOC2 and SDA1, respectively). Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of additional C. elegansorthologs of yeast ribosome biogenesis factors display phenotypes similar to depletion of progenes. We conclude that the C. elegansdistal sheath is particularly sensitive to alterations in ribosome biogenesis and that ribosome biogenesis defects in one tissue can non-autonomously influence proliferation in an adjacent tissue.

    schema:about "Abstract: Sex-determination in Caenorhabditis elegans requires regulation of gene transcription and protein activity and stability. sel-10 encodes a WD40-repeat-containing F-box protein that likely mediates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of important sex-determination factors. Loss of sel-10 results in a mild masculinization of hermaphrodites, whereas dominant alleles of sel-10, such as sel-10(n1074), cause a more severe masculinization, including a reversal of the life versus death decision in sex-specific neurons. To investigate about how sel-10 regulates sex-determination, we conducted a sel-10(n1074) suppressor screen and isolated a weak loss-of-function allele of skr-1, one of 21 Skp1-related genes in C. elegans. Skp1, Cullin, and F-box proteins, such as SEL-10, are components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex. We present genetic evidence that the sel-10(n1074) masculinization phenotype is dependent upon skr-1 and cul-1 activity. Furthermore, we show that the SKR-1(M140I) weak loss-of-function mutation interferes with SKR-1/SEL-10 binding. Unexpectedly, we found that the G567E substitution in SEL-10 caused by the n1074 allele impairs the binding of SEL-10 to SKR-1 and the dimerization of SEL-10, which may be important for SEL-10 function. Our results suggest that SKR-1, CUL-1 and SEL-10 constitute an SCF E3 ligase complex that plays an important role in modulating sex-determination and LIN-12/Notch signaling in C. elegans.

    schema:about "Optical PEBBLE (probes encapsulated by biologically localized embedding) nanosensors have been developed for dissolved oxygen using organically modified silicate (ormosil) nanoparticles as a matrix. The ormosil nanoparticles are prepared via a sol-gel-based process, which includes the formation of core particles with phenyltri-methoxysilane as a precursor followed by the formation of a coating layer with methyltrimethoxysilane as a precursor. The average diameter of the resultant particles is 120 nm. These sensors incorporate the oxygen-sensitive platinum porphyrin dye as an indicator and an oxygen-insensitive dye as a reference for ratiometric intensity measurement. Two pairs of indicator dye and reference dye, respectively, platinum(II) octaethylporphine and 3,3'- dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate, and platinum- (II) octaethylporphine ketone and octaethylporphine, were used. The sensors have excellent sensitivity with an overall quenching response of 97%, as well as excellent linearity of the Stern -- Volmer plot (r? = 0.999) over the whole range of dissolved oxygen concentrations (0-43 ppm). In vitro intracellular changes of dissolved oxygen due to cell respiration were monitored, with gene gun injected PEBBLES, in rat C6 glioma cells. A significant change was observed with a fluorescence ratio increase of up to 500% after 1 h, for nine different sets of cells, which corresponds to a 90% reduction in terms of dissolved oxygen concentration. These results clearly show the validity of the delivery method for intracellular studies of PEBBLE sensors, as well as the high sensitivity, which is needed to achieve real-lime measurements of intracellular dissolved oxygen concentration.

The reactions were monitored by aliquot removal and subsequent proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) analysis. 1H NMR analysis allowed for the calculation of the average degree of fatty acid unsaturation ( DU = 1.52) in oil and methyl ester. 1H NMR analysis also provided initial rates of methyl ester formation and an activation energy of 27.2 kJ/mol. The time-dependent concentration data revealed substantial reaction progress toward equilibrium after only 120 s at a reduced temperature of 10 C. Understanding the resonance shifts in the 1H NMR spectra of starting materials and products allows for quantitation of reaction progress that is in good agreement with results obtained using other analytical methods." ;

    schema:about "Modulated optical nanoprobes (MOONs) are microscopic (spherical and aspherical) fluorescent particles designed to emit varying intensities of light in a manner that depends on particle orientation. MOONs can be prepared over a broad size range, allowing them to be tailored to applications including intracellular sensors, using submicrometer MOONs, and immunoassays, using 1-10 mum MOONs. When particle orientation is controlled remotely, using magnetic fields (MagMOONs), it allows modulation of fluorescence intensity in a selected temporal pattern. In the absence of external fields, or material that responds to external fields, the particles tumble erratically due to Brownian thermal forces (Brownian MOONs). These erratic changes in orientation cause the MOONs to blink. The temporal pattern of blinking reveals information about the local theological environment and any forces and torques acting on the MOONs, including biomechanical forces as observed in macrophages. The rotational diffusion rate of Brownian MOONs is inversely proportional to the particle volume and hydrodynamic shape factor, for constant temperature and viscosity. Changes in the particle volume and shape due to binding, deformation, or aggregation can be studied using the temporal time pattern from the probes. The small size and the large number of MOONs that can be viewed simultaneously provide local measurements of physical properties, in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, as well as global statistical ensemble properties." ;

    schema:about "We have studied the oxidation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanes and alkenes with a thermal beam of OH radicals. The target films were produced by bonding alkane thiols and alkene thiols to a gold surface and the SAMs are mounted in a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 10(-9) Torr. Hydroxyl radicals were produced by a corona discharge in an Ar/H2O2/water mixture. The resultant molecular beam was scanned by an electrostatic hexapole and the OH radicals [4 (+/- 1) x 10(11) OH radicals cm(-2) sec(-1)] were focused onto the target SAM. All of the hydroxyl radicals impinging on the SAM surface are rotationally (J '' <= 5/2) cold. The vibrational temperature of the radicals is estimated to be 1700-3400 K which implies that between 5% and 22% of the hydroxyl radical beam is OH upsilon-1 and the remainder (95% to 78%) is OH upsilon=vertical bar. The collision energy of the beam with the SAM is 333 cm(-1) corresponding to a 485 K thermal beam. We employed reflection/ absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) to monitor the reactivity of OH with an alkane and an alkene SAM. RAIRS demonstrated that a 10 min dose of OH radicals largely destroys the CH3- groups at the interface. This corresponds to a deposition of 2.4 x 10(14) OH cm(-2) or about 60% of the SAM monolayer. Oxidation of an undec-10-ene-1-thiol (HS(CH2)(9)HC = CH2) SAM with OH radicals proceeded more quickly with all the terminal alkenes, -CH = CH2, eliminated within 5 min following deposition of 1.2 x 10(14) radicals. We believe that the OH radicals initiate a radical-induced polymerization of the alkene film." ;

    schema:about "Objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) holds that American culture coaxes women to develop observers' views of their bodies. The present study was designed to test whether a state of self-objectification can be automatically activated by subtle exposure to objectifying words. A state of self-objectification or of bodily empowerment was primed by the use of a scrambled sentence task. Women's ratings of negative emotions were higher and their ratings of the appeal of physical sex lower when primed with self-objectification than when primed with body competence. Men's ratings were unaffected by the primes. The results of this study suggest that mere exposure to objectifying media can play a significant role in the initiation of a self-objectified state along with its attendant psychological consequences for women." ;

    schema:about "The Fosdick Mountains, West Antarctica, expose a 15 x 80 km migmatite-cored gneiss dome consisting of migmatitic gneisses, diatexite migmatite, and sub-horizontal leucogranite sheets. The Fosdick dome was emplaced and exhumed in the mid-Cretaceous due to oblique extension associated with the West Antarctic Rift system along the West Antarctic-New Zealand segment of East Gondwana. The dome is bounded to the south by a dextral oblique detachment structure and to the north by an inferred dextral strike-slip fault. Within the Fosdick dome and in the detachment zone, granite occupies leucosomes, dikes, sills, and dilatant and shear structures. The pattern of kilometer-scale domains of migmatite and granite suggest that lithologic variations and heterogeneous deformation (boudinage) resulted in pressure gradients that enhanced melt flow and magma accumulation in the Fosdick dome. Steep foliations are overprinted, folded, and transposed by subhorizontal fabrics. The crosscutting relationship is interpreted as a transition from wrench deformation to oblique divergence. Steep structures in the dome host concordant, subvertical leucosome and granite sheets yielding SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages between ca. 117 and 114 Ma. Prevalent subhorizontal domains host large volumes of subhorizontal diatexite migmatite and granite sheets that yield U-Pb zircon ages between ca. 109 and 102 Ma. These ages indicate a timescale for melt influx of approximately 15 Ma and that the transition from wrench to oblique divergence may have occurred in as little as 5 Ma. Granites with crystallization ages between ca. 109 and 102 Ma were also emplaced in the South Fosdick Detachment zone, indicating that the detachment was active during oblique divergence. SHRIMP U-Pb titanite ages between ca. 102 and 97 Ma for late-to post-tectonic diorite dikes are interpreted as emplacement ages and give a minimum age for gneissic foliation development during detachment faulting. The Fosdick Mountains preserve a record of the middle to lower crustal response to a transition from wrench to oblique extensional deformation. Overprinting structural relationships show that a change in the angle of oblique extension can induce accumulation of sub-horizontal magma sheets and lead to initiation of a detachment zone.

    schema:about "This study examined the influence of male sexual orientation on the objectification of self and others. Objectification is a process by which a perceiver adopts a purely externalized view of either the self or another, a process by which a person's body becomes the main representation of that person's identity. A sample of 29 heterosexual and 30 gay men was asked to complete an objectification questionnaire measuring the degree to which they viewed themselves, other men, and women in body appearance based versus body competence based terms. The results demonstrated that gay men objectified themselves and other men to a greater degree than did heterosexual men. Heterosexual men objectified women marginally more than did gay men. Among gay men, there was a strong relationship between self-objectification and the degree to which other men were objectified, whereas self-objectification among heterosexual men did not predict objectification of others." ;

The first experiment measured reaction times for identifying playing card stimuli in three conditions: (a) where all the stimuli were standard playing cards, (b) where stimuli had color reversed (trick), or (c) which included both regular and trick card stimuli (mixed set). Participants were equally adept at identifying regular and trick stimuli in homogenous sets but took longer to identify the same stimuli in a mixed set. The second experiment, a conceptual replication of Bruner and Postman's original experiment, obtained recognition thresholds for regular and trick stimuli while measuring participants' frustration. Participants responded similarly to procedural difficulties for both trick and regular stimuli. An analysis of participants' responses shows that participants used systematic trial-and-error strategy to identify any ambiguous stimulus. These findings are inconsistent with an interpretation of resistance to incongruities." ;

    schema:about "Pronounced transient global warming events between 60 and 50 million years ago have been linked to rapid injection of isotopically-light carbon to the ocean-atmosphere system(1,2). It is, however, unclear whether the largest of the hyperthermals, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ref. 3), had a similar origin(4,5) as the subsequent greenhouse climate events(1,6), such as the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 and H2 events. The timing and evolution of these events is well documented in marine records(7,8), but is not well constrained on land. Here we report carbon isotope records from palaeosol carbonate nodules from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA that record the hyperthermals. Our age model is derived from cyclostratigraphy, and shows a similar structure of events in the terrestrial and marine records. Moreover, the magnitude of the terrestrial isotope excursions is consistently scaled with the marine records, suggesting that the severity of local palaeoenvironmetal change during each event was proportional to the size of the global carbon isotope excursion. We interpret this consistency as an indication of similar mechanisms of carbon release during all three hyperthermals. However, unlike during the PETM (refs 9,10), terrestrial environmental change during the subsequent hyperthermals is not linked to substantial turnover of mammalian fauna in the Bighorn Basin." ;

    schema:about "Central Asia has served as a corridor for human migrations providing trading routes since ancient times. It has functioned as a conduit connecting Europe and the Middle East with South Asia and far Eastern civilizations. Therefore, the study of populations in this region is essential for a comprehensive understanding of early human dispersal on the Eurasian continent. Although Y- chromosome distributions in Central Asia have been widely surveyed, present-day Afghanistan remains poorly characterized genetically. The present study addresses this lacuna by analyzing 190 Pathan males from Afghanistan using high-resolution Y-chromosome binary markers. In addition, haplotype diversity for its most common lineages (haplogroups R1a1a*-M198 and L3-M357) was estimated using a set of 15 Y-specific STR loci. The observed haplogroup distribution suggests some degree of genetic isolation of the northern population, likely due to the Hindu Kush mountain range separating it from the southern Afghans who have had greater contact with neighboring Pathans from Pakistan and migrations from the Indian subcontinent. Our study demonstrates genetic similarities between Pathans from Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which are characterized by the predominance of haplogroup R1a1a*-M198 (>50%) and the sharing of the same modal haplotype. Furthermore, the high frequencies of R1a1a-M198 and the presence of G2c-M377 chromosomes in Pathans might represent phylogenetic signals from Khazars, a common link between Pathans and Ashkenazi groups, whereas the absence of E1b1b1a2-V13 lineage does not support their professed Greek ancestry.

    schema:about "Sauropod dinosaurs were the largest vertebrates ever to walk the Earth, and as mega-herbivores they were important parts of terrestrial ecosystems. In the Late Jurassic-aged Morrison depositional basin of western North America, these animals occupied lowland river-floodplain settings characterized by a seasonally dry climate(1,2). Massive herbivores with high nutritional and water needs could periodically experience nutritional and water stress under these conditions, and thus the common occurrence of sauropods in this basin has remained a paradox. Energetic arguments and mammalian analogues have been used to suggest that migration allowed sauropods access to food and water resources over a wide region or during times of drought or both(3,4), but there has been no direct support for these hypotheses. Here we compare oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of tooth-enamel carbonate from the sauropod Camarasaurus with those of ancient soil, lake and wetland (that is, 'authigenic') carbonates that formed in lowland settings. We demonstrate that certain populations of these animals did in fact undertake seasonal migrations of several hundred kilometres from lowland to upland environments. This ability to describe patterns of sauropod movement will help to elucidate the role that migration played in the ecology and evolution of gigantism of these and associated dinosaurs." ;

    schema:about "We present new results on the Hubble diagram of distant type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. This makes it possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitly comparing SNe residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with the larger sample. The cosmological parameters derived from these SNe Ia hosted by presumed dust-free early-type galaxies support earlier claims for a cosmological constant, which we demonstrate at similar or equal to5sigma significance, and the internal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (A(B)<0.2). Thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely to systematically dim distant SNe Ia in a manner that would produce a spurious cosmological constant. Our analysis is based on new Hubble Space Telescope STIS 'snapshot' images and Keck-II echellette spectroscopy at the locations of the SNe, spanning the redshift range 0<z<0.8. Selecting from the sample discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP), we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant SNe using the combination of STIS imaging, Keck spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry. The distant data are analysed in comparison with a low-redshift sample of 25 SNe Ia re-calibrated according to the precepts of the SCP. The scatter observed in the SNe Ia Hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. We find this scatter is smallest for SNe Ia occurring in early-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies. Moreover, SNe residing in late-type hosts appear similar or equal to0.14+/-0.09 mag fainter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those in early-type hosts, as expected if a modest amount of dust extinction is a contributing factor. As in previous studies, these results are broadly independent of whether corrections based upon SN light-curve shapes are performed. We also use our high-redshift data set to search for morphological dependences in the SNe light curves, as are sometimes seen in low-redshift samples. No significant trends are found, possibly because the range of light-curve widths is too limited." ;

    schema:about "It has been 30 years since environmental concern was first expressed over the Prospect of large-scale resource development in the Arctic. Human effects are more extensive within the tundra biome now than at any time in the past. With or without predicted climatic changes, interaction among different natural and contemporary anthropogenic disturbance regimes are bound to have a significant effect on local and regional vegetation patterns and plant migration. We summarize the results of recent studies of patchy anthropogenic disturbance. We pay particular attention to the natural regeneration of plant communities, emphasize patch dynamics over tbe medium term (20-75 years), and discuss the data in the context of popular models of vegetation change following disturbance. Disturbance is important because it produces patches of partially or totally denuded ground that permit propagule establishment but may also open affected areas to erosion. Even relatively low-intensity, small-scale disturbances have immediate and persistent effects on arctic vegetation and soils. On all but the wettest sites, the patches support new, relatively stable vegetation states. Where slope is minimal, such disturbances are capable of expanding over large areas in as short it time as 4 years. The effects result in an artificial mosaic of patches of highly variable quality and quantity that comprise feeding and nesting habitats for terrestrial herbivores." ;

    schema:about "We have incorporated a pulsed, hyperthermal nozzle with a cryostat to study the matrix-isolated infrared spectroscopy of organic radicals. The radicals are produced by pyrolysis in a heated, narrow-bore (1-mm-diam) SiC tube and then expanded into the cryostat vacuum chamber. The combination of high nozzle temperature (up to 1800 K) and near-sonic flow velocities (on the order of 10(4) cm s(-1)) through the length of the 2 cm tube allows for high yield of radicals (approximately 10(13) radicals pulse(-1)) and low residence time (on the order of 10 mus) in the nozzle. We have used this hyperthermal nozzle/matrix isolation experiment to observe the IR spectra of complex radicals such as allyl radical (CH2CHCH2), phenyl radical (C6H5), and methylperoxyl radical (CH3OO). IR spectra of samples produced with a hyperthermal nozzle are remarkably clean and relatively free of interfering radical chemistry. By monitoring the unimolecular thermal decomposition of allyl ethyl ether in the nozzle using matrix IR spectroscopy, we have derived the residence time (tau(nozzle)) of the gas pulse in the nozzle to be around 30 mus.

    schema:about "The gap between men's and women's choice of college majors has not changed over the past two decades. One aspect of the debate surrounding their choice is the presence or absence of women and minority faculty role models who could attract female and minority students to a particular major. The authors provide new evidence using micro-data from student records, transcript records, and faculty records from the Colgate University classes of 1988-2000. The authors found role-model effects for women, minorities, and men. The proportion of classes taken with a faculty member ï¿½like-youï¿½ has a positive effect on the probability that a student will choose that major. These results support the idea that faculty members can exert a role-model effect on women and minority undergraduates. Reprinted by permission of the publisher." ;

The authors describe four approaches that have allowed students to get their work published: (1) identify a topic, such as competitive balance in sports, and have students work on various subtopics, such as specific sports; (2) develop a large data set and have students work on different problems using it; (3) divide a quantitative problem into distinct parts and have individual students work on each part; and (4) divide a qualitative problem into distinct parts and have individual students work on their own part. The authors also address the challenges of working with undergraduates: limited time and resources, limited skills, and the tedium of gathering data." ;

    schema:about "Though critics have made a number of telling points against the Bush administration's conduct of the Iraq war, the most serious problems facing Iraq and its American occupiers - criminal anarchy and lawlessness, a raging insurgency and a society divided into rival and antagonistic groups - were virtually inevitable consequences that flowed from the act of war itself. Military and civilian planners were culpable in failing to plan for certain tasks, but the most serious problems had no good solution. Even so, there are lessons to be learned. These include the danger that the imperatives of 'force protection' may sacrifice the broader political mission of US forces and the need for scepticism over the capacity of outsiders to develop the skill and expertise required to reconstruct decapitated states." ;

A stratified, snowball sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) service members (n = 17) from across all branches of the armed services were interviewed within two weeks of repeal (September 20, 2011). We find evidence that DADT was implicated in the structuring of military culture in terms of five irreconcilable contradictions: values, heroism, wartime, control, and silence. Military culture had moved in the direction of acceptance of LGBQ service members long before repeal, without the recognition of many leaders who had entered military service decades earlier." ;

We sought to determine whether proprioceptive feedback from body postures operate differently for women and men. Participants received success feedback when in either an upright or slumped posture, which was covertly manipulated. Results showed that for men the effects of posture were intuitive and appropriate: receiving success feedback while upright enhanced performance self-ratings. In contrast, after adopting an upright posture, women went on after success feedback to perform more poorly and make more negative self-ratings, than after adopting a slumped posture. A number of theories are offered as potential explanations for this gender effect." ;

Until 2008, house prices, home construction and population growth appeared to be locked in an ever-increasing upward trend. With little historical experience to the contrary, water right market prices similarly appeared to be driven by real estate development. The collapse of the housing market in the last four years provides an opportunity to examine the connection between the real estate and water markets. It is found that Middle Rio Grande Basin water right prices are influenced by housing prices, per capita income in the buyer's county, buyer type, point of diversion, and transaction volume. However, significant price dispersion remains, raising the question of how efficiently this market is currently working." ;

This paper recounts the history of the implementation of these innovative institutions, and examines difficulties encountered in this experience, with particular focus on the differences between the predominantly white, middle-class feminists that originated the idea and the predominantly black, working-class policewomen charged with carrying it out. Anti-essentialist theory is useful for understanding the flawed logic that produced inappropriate expectations of policewomen. However, the paper concludes that this perspective offers little direction for furthering the nascent reform of law enforcement, and offers a feminist version of an imagined communities model in its place." ;

    schema:about "Neoliberal market reformers stress the 'market building instincts' of private owners to justify rapid forms of property transformation under illiberal political conditions. Private owners demand the institutions of the self-restraining state to protect property from various forms of expropriation and to enforce contracts. Legacy theorists counter that under illiberal political conditions, economic insiders are more likely to capture the benefits of privatization programs and then seek exemption from the rule of law rather than application of it. We employ a 'path contingency' approach to show that under illiberal, competitive authoritarian conditions, privatization recipients and other private economic agents are unlikely to demand the basic institutions of market democracy. Yet, this is by no means a stable set of affairs. Political inequality and its attendant rent-seeking behavior will likely delay or distort growth and can contribute to economic and political instability. Political crisis may follow as regimes face societal frustration and energized, united political oppositions. Such crises are moments of uncertainty and flux. Crises provide private economic agents in particular with an opportunity to reconsider their ties to an illiberal regime. This paper examines these propositions during illiberal regime crises in Serbia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.

    schema:about "This essay explores William Blake's complex textual and spiritual rendering of John Milton in his illuminated book, Milton a Poem. Responding to authorial anxieties within John Milton's own poetry and prose works, Milton reveals within its allegorical structure a purposeful conflation of corporeal, technological, agricultural and religious lexicons. The work reflects the material means of its own production while simultaneously revealing much about how Blake conceived his own radicalized visionary and artistic mission. Emphasizing the material, Christological and symbolic dimensions of Blake's linguistic play, the essay thus examines the relationship between these vocabularies - more specifically between the world of the print shop and the author's vision within the poem. In doing so my reading of the work highlights the political dangers associated with resurrecting the Miltonic corpus in an era when Milton's republican legacy sat uneasily alongside his literary achievements. By materializing Milton's body as print, Blake's work textually (re-) inscribes this politically volatile figure to advance a notion of radical authorship that defies corporeal limitations.

    schema:about "The environmental education through filmmaking project, a case study at an alternative US public high school, investigates environmental literacies of 'at-risk' students who produced two short documentary films, one on recycling and one on water conservation. The filmmaking project sought to promote students' awareness of environmental issues and increase their environmental literacy by exploring the conservation topics on multiple levels: carrying out research for their films, conducting interviews, and operating camera equipment. After completing the projects, we conducted focus group interviews with two control groups and two filmmaking groups and analyzed students' responses using coded qualitative methodology to develop three theoretical constructs: (1) students' construct knowledge about the environment through social processes that include interrelated influences from school, family, and the media; (2) apathy about the environment is common among 'at-risk' high school students who perceive their school culture does not focus on environmental education; and (3) students more readily adopt environmentally responsible behaviors when provided with opportunities to develop their own understanding of connections between personal actions and associated environmental consequences. Qualitative analysis of the focus group interview responses suggests filmmaking projects provided such opportunities and were successful in introducing strategies that encourage environmentally responsible behaviors amongst students." ;

We illustrate these elements through our experience teaching field-based environmental studies courses, but also emphasize ways in which practical environmental education can be effectively incorporated into campus-based classes.

    schema:about "A commentary on an article by Paul Baer et al. that appears in this issue on pp. 267?281. In their article, Baer and colleagues propose a Greenhouse Development Rights (GDR) framework grounded in two fundemental ethical considerations: causal responsibility and the capacity to pay. The writer suggests some ways in which the framework could be refined, focusing in particular on the framework's ability to align the moral principles on which it is based with the mechanisms by which it is implemented. She outlines some suggested changes to the responsibility component of the Responsibility-Capacity Index, which ascertains each nation's share of costs for climate mitigation and/or adaptation." ;

    schema:about "Marian wrote two virtually unknown articles engaging the figure of Athena, patron goddess of Athens, of war, wisdom, and weaving (the primary activity of Greek women). Her discussion of Aeschylus's Oresteia (Tolpin, 1969) shows her struggling with a classical psychoanalytic approach to the text, her spirit moving already to forward edge interpretations. In her article on H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), Freud, and Athena (Tolpin, 1991), she grapples with Freud's understanding that H.D. is like the \"castrated goddess\" figurine on his desk (a small bronze Athena who has lost her spear), and she transforms Freud's classical understanding of H.D...

    schema:about "In this response, the author agrees with Frank Summers's view that the goal of any analysis is the flowering of the nuclear self, and that Kohut's term, 'nuclear self,' has not been sufficiently emphasized or understood by either self or relational self psychologists. The author also suggests that Summers's emphasis on the action program of the nuclear self is deeply attuned with Kohut's views and is crucial for us to hold in mind. However, the author takes exception to Summers's claim that the search for the nuclear self in an analysis occurs only after the transmuting internalizations of the selfobject transferences are completed. The author suggests, rather, that Summers's analytic stance is completely explicable within the context of Kohut's and E. S. Wolf's definitions of the mature selfobject transferences, and that Kohut and others focused on the hope and possibility of the analysand's emerging agency throughout the analysis.

    schema:about "The Kyoto Protocol has initiated Clean Development Mechanism projects in developing countries as one means to offset carbon emitted in developed nations. Biofuels may be a viable solution, but we argue here that it may also compete with local smallholder farming systems and labour resources. This study assesses the integration of tree bio-diesel crop Jatropha curcas into smallholder agriculture in Tamil Nadu, India using data collected from 66 farms through surveys and interviews. Jatropha cultivation carries significant risks for the smallholders. Jatropha competes for space and harvest labour with other market and subsistence crops and does not produce any economic returns until three years after planting. If the jatropha harvests or market price fail or fluctuate, smallholders could default on their loans. This risk could lead to significant changes in the land-holding class structure. Climate change policies, non-governmental organizationss, and national and regional governments should support landholders to sustainably integrate a new crop like jatropha into current holdings, otherwise the current alternative energy revolution could create more problems than it solves. Smallholders are particularly vulnerable to economic risk and crop failure exposure even with well-planned biofuel policies." ;

    schema:about "The contents of mineral elements in phloem vary among trees, and this variation is often associated with host choice by diverse parasites and herbivores. The relative importance of genotype and environment was analyzed in order to determine the broad-sense heritability (H-2) of accumulation of 15 elements (Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Na, P, Si, Ti, Zn) in phloem of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa Laws.). The phloem was collected in 1997 from trees planted between 1979 and 1983 at two locations in the Sierra Nevada of California. Each plantation consists of multiple copies, called ramets, of specific genotypes grafted onto root stocks of very heterogeneous genotypes. Within each plantation, we sampled five ramets of each of 17 different genotypes. The same 17 genotypes were analyzed at two locations. There are many differences in heritabilities and other features of elemental contents between the two plantations. The H-2 values range from 0.0 to 0.65 and vary between the plantations, with 13 of the 15 elements having a H-2 of at least 0.3 in at least one of two locations. There are also significant differences in elemental contents among genotypes at both locations. Finally, the correlation between locations in element contents of the 17 genotypes is significant for some elements (Ca, Fe, K, N, and Si), whereas for the other elements, there was no correlation between locations, even when H-2 estimates were high at both locations. These patterns provide strong evidence for genotype-by-environment interactions. The results are relevant to tree physiology and ecology as they indicate that mechanisms of element transport and storage are influenced by shoots somewhat independently of root systems. The results also underscore the potential evolutionary significance of intergenotype variation in biochemical profile of nutritive tissues in the context of host-plant choice." ;

She identifies a measure of the demand for education that is based on rising populations and households' incomes, as well as a supply relationship between enrollment and expenditures on instruction and materials. She points out that disequilibrium on the demand side exerted a drag on school attachment for the period studied, but increases in the ?supply? of educational infrastructure, in the form of instruction and materials, did promote enrollment." ;

Combined with earlier Supernova Cosmology Project data, the new SNe yield a measurement of the mass density Omega M = 0.25(-0.06)(+0.07) (statistical) +/- 0.04 (identified systematics), or equivalently, a cosmological constant of Omega(A) = 0.75(-0.07)(+0.06) (statistical) +/- 0.04 (identified systematics), under the assumptions of a. at universe and that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter has a constant value w = -1. When the SN results are combined with independent flat-universe measurements of Omega(M) from cosmic microwave background and galaxy redshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of w = -1.05(-0.20)(+0.15) (statistical) +/- 0.09 (identified systematic), if w is assumed to be constant in time. In addition to high-precision light-curve measurements, the new data offer greatly improved color measurements of the high-redshift SNe and hence improved host galaxy extinction estimates. These extinction measurements show no anomalous negative E( B-V) at high redshift. The precision of the measurements is such that it is possible to perform a host galaxy extinction correction directly for individual SNe without any assumptions or priors on the parent E(B-V) distribution. Our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that dark energy is required with P(Omega(A) > 0) > 0.99, a result consistent with previous and current SN analyses that rely on the identification of a low-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinction distribution." ;

    schema:about "We present an extensive new time series of spectroscopic data of the peculiar SN 1999aa in NGC 2595. Our data set includes 25 optical spectra between -11 and +58 days with respect to B-band maximum light, providing an unusually complete time history. The early spectra resemble those of an SN 1991T-like object but with a relatively strong Ca H and K absorption feature. The first clear sign of Si II lambda6355, characteristic of Type Ia supernovae, is found at day - 7, and its velocity remains constant up to at least the first month after B-band maximum light. The transition to normal-looking spectra is found to occur earlier than in SN 1991T, suggesting SN 1999aa as a possible link between SN 1991T - like and Branch-normal supernovae. Comparing the observations with synthetic spectra, doubly ionized Fe, Si, and Ni are identified at early epochs. These are characteristic of SN 1991T - like objects. Furthermore, in the day - 11 spectrum, evidence is found for an absorption feature that could be identified as high velocity C II lambda6580 or Halpha. At the same epoch C III lambda4648.8 at photospheric velocity is probably responsible for the absorption feature at 4500 Angstrom. High-velocity Ca is found around maximum light together with Si II and Fe II confined in a narrow velocity window. Implied constraints on supernovae progenitor systems and explosion hydrodynamic models are briefly discussed." ;

    schema:about "We present spectra for 14 high-redshift (0.17 < z < 0.83) supernovae, which were discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project as part of a campaign to measure cosmological parameters. The spectra are used to determine the redshift and classify the supernova type, essential information if the supernovae are to be used for cosmological studies. Redshifts were derived either from the spectrum of the host galaxy or from the spectrum of the supernova itself. We present evidence that these supernovae are of Type Ia (SNe Ia) by matching to spectra of nearby supernovae. We find that the dates of the spectra relative to maximum light determined from this fitting process are consistent with the dates determined from the photometric light curves, and, moreover, the spectral time sequences for SNe Ia at low and high redshift are indistinguishable. We also show that the expansion velocities measured from blueshifted Ca H and K are consistent with those measured for low-redshift SNe Ia. From these first-level quantitative comparisons we find no evidence for evolution in SN Ia properties between these low- and high-redshift samples. Thus, even though our samples may not be complete, we conclude that there is a population of SNe Ia at high redshift whose spectral properties match those at low redshift." ;

    schema:about "A plant species that occupies a large geographic range must survive in a variety of environments. Impatiens capensis, an herbaceous annual that grows contiguously from the east coast of North America to the Colorado Rocky Mountains, prefers moist environments and is easily susceptible to drought. Impatiens populations at the species' western range limit (Colorado) must endure a dramatically different environment than eastern populations do (Rhode Island and Illinois). This study investigated the stress response of a weedy annual at its range limit by examining how regional populations of I. capensis morphologically, physiologically, and phenologically adjust to drought. The results suggest that each population has evolved along a different evolutionary axis; each population exhibits a unique strategy for responding to drought stress. Rhode Island populations have evolved along a temporal axis to avoid stress with an accelerated phenology. An Illinois population has evolved along a physiological axis and exhibits a drought-tolerance strategy. Colorado populations have evolved along a morphological axis and tolerate drought. Thus, dealing with drought stress may involve population differentiation along different axes of functional plasticity." ;

We add two SNe from this sample to a rest-frame I-band Hubble diagram, doubling the number of high redshift supernovae on this diagram. This I-band Hubble diagram is consistent with a flat universe (Omega(M), Omega(A)) = (0.29, 0.71). A homogeneous distribution of large grain dust in the intergalactic medium (replenishing dust) is incompatible with the data and is excluded at the 5 sigma confidence level, if the SN host galaxy reddening is corrected assuming R(V) = 1.75. We use both optical and infrared observations to compare photometric properties of distant SNe Ia with those of nearby objects. We find generally good agreement with the expected color evolution for all SNe except the highest redshift SN in our sample (SN 1997ek at z = 0.863) which shows a peculiar color behavior. We also present spectra obtained from ground-based telescopes for type identification and determination of redshift." ;

    schema:about "We report on work to increase the number of well-measured Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshifts. Light curves, including high signal-to-noise Hubble Space Telescope data, and spectra of six SNe Ia that were discovered during 2001, are presented. Additionally, for the two SNe with z > 1, we present ground-based J-band photometry from Gemini and the Very Large Telescope. These are among the most distant SNe Ia for which ground-based near-IR observations have been obtained. We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in the literature to the Union compilation. We have made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most important ones being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2 fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We call this new compilation, consisting of 557 SNe, the Union2 compilation. The flat concordance Lambda CDM model remains an excellent fit to the Union2 data with the best-fit constant equation-of-state parameter w = -0.997(-0.054)(+0.050)(stat)(-0.082)(+0.077)(stat + sys together) for a flat universe, or w = -1.038(-0.059)(+0.056)(stat)(-0.097)+(0.093)(stat + sys together) with curvature. We also present improved constraints on w(z). While no significant change in w with redshift is detected, there is still considerable room for evolution in w. The strength of the constraints depends strongly on redshift. In particular, at z greater than or similar to 1, the existence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained by the data." ;

    schema:about "Production of granite in the middle to lower crust and emplacement into the middle to upper crust at convergent plate margins is the dominant mechanism of crustal differentiation. The Fosdick Mountains of West Antarctica host migmatitic paragneisses and orthogneisses corresponding to the middle to lower crust and granites emplaced as dikes, sills and small plutons, which record processes of intracrustal differentiation along the East Gondwana margin. U-Pb chronology on magmatic zircon from granites reveals emplacement at c. 358-336 Ma and c. 115-98 Ma, consistent with a polyphase tectonic evolution of the region during Devonian-Carboniferous continental arc activity and Cretaceous continental rifting. The gneisses and granites exposed in the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex were derived from Early Paleozoic quartzose turbidites of the Swanson Formation and Ford Granodiorite suite calc-alkaline plutonic rocks, both of which are widely distributed outside the Fosdick Mountains and have affinity with rock elsewhere in East Gondwana. Granites of both Carboniferous and Cretaceous age have distinct chemical signatures that reflect different melting reactions and accessory phase behavior in contrasting sources. Based on whole-rock major and trace element geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotope compositions, Carboniferous granites with low Rb/Sr are interpreted to be products of melting of the Ford Granodiorite suite. Extant mineral equilibria modeling indicates that the Ford Granodiorite suite compositions produce melt volumes > 10 vol. % at temperatures above biotite stability, involving the breakdown of hornblende + plagioclase, consistent with the high CaO and Na2O contents in the low Rb/Sr granites. The Carboniferous low Rb/Sr granites show a sequence from near-melt compositions to compositions with increasing amounts of early crystallized biotite and plagioclase and evidence for apatite dissolution in the source. Carboniferous granites derived from the Swanson Formation are scarce, suggesting that the significant quantities of melt produced from the now residual paragneisses were emplaced at shallower crustal levels than are now exposed. The Cretaceous granites are divided into two distinct groups. An older group of granites (c. 115-110 Ma) has compositions consistent with a dominant Ford Granodiorite source, and characteristics that indicate that they may be less evolved equivalents of the regionally exposed Byrd Coast Granite suite at higher crustal levels. The younger group of granites (c. 109-102 Ma) has distinct light rare earth element depleted signatures. The chemical and isotopic data suggest that these granites were derived from partial melting of both fertile and residual Swanson Formation and had low water contents, indicating that the source rocks may have been dehydrated prior to anatexis as the Byrd Coast Granite suite magmas were transferring through and accumulating at higher crustal levels. The Cretaceous granites derived from the Swanson Formation make up a prominent horizontally sheeted leucogranite complex. The accumulation of these melts probably facilitated melt-induced weakening of the crust during a well-documented transition from regional shortening to regional extension, the formation of a detachment structure, and rapid exhumation of the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex. These multiple episodes of melting along the East Gondwana margin resulted in initial stabilization of the continental crust in the Carboniferous and further intracrustal differentiation in the Cretaceous." ;

    schema:about "Mast seeding is a reproductive strategy in some perennial plants defined as synchronous production of large seed crops at irregular intervals. One widely accepted theory to explain this behaviour is the predator satiation hypothesis, which states that the synchronous and variable production of seeds within a population will maximize the probability of seed survival through satiation of seed predators. Although some short-term studies have documented the influence of variable and synchronized production of seeds on herbivore attack rate during one or few mast years, long-term data including multiple mast seeding years and patterns of cone production and herbivore attack on individual trees are needed to assess (i) how cone production, variability and synchrony affect individual plant fitness and (ii) the functional responses of seed predators to mast seeding events. We tested these objectives, collecting long-term (29years) data on female seed cone production and rates of seed predator attack from 217 individual contiguous trees within a Pinus ponderosa population. Our results support the predator satiation hypothesis. First, we found high interannual synchrony and variability in seed cone production and a type II functional response of seed predators to available cones. Secondly, years with high cone production (mast years) had markedly lower rates of seed predator attack than years of low production (i.e. a population-level satiation effect). Thirdly, within mast years, individuals with high cone production had markedly lower rates of attack than individuals with low cone production (i.e. an individual-level satiation effect). Finally, individual trees with greater synchrony and more variable cone production suffered lower rates of attack. Synthesis: Our long-term data on individual trees lend strong support to the hypothesis that mast seeding in Pinus ponderosa has evolved in response to natural selection from insect seed predators." ;

    schema:about "1. Reduced metabolic rate among cave organisms compared with surface species has long been suggested as an adaptation to food shortage in cave environments. However, comparisons of metabolic rates between species have not often included closely related surface and cave species. By measuring metabolic rate across three seasons and over a range of body sizes, we examined the hypothesis that the routine metabolic rate of Gammarus acherondytes, a federally listed stygobitic amphipod, is lower than that of the closely related stygophilic Gammarus troglophilus. To determine if human activities increased the supply of organic matter to caves, we also examined the relationship between residential development and bacterial contamination in water wells. 2. For G. acherondytes, the slope of the overall relationship between oxygen consumption and body dry mass did not differ from zero and did not vary seasonally, whereas for G. troglophilus it was positive and higher in summer than in winter and spring. These results provide insights into a potential novel metabolic adaptation among stygobites. Higher metabolic rate in young G. acherondytes would allow efficient use of typically transient energy sources and a low metabolic rate at larger body sizes would increase survival through periods of food scarcity. 3. The number of wells with faecal coliform contamination was weakly but positively correlated with the number of residential building permits, indicating that surface land-use changes probably increase the availability of energy in groundwater systems inhabited by G. acherondytes. This may give stygophilic animals, with higher metabolic rates, a competitive advantage in the caves, thus reducing the abundance of stygobites such as G. acherondytes." ;

    schema:about "We identified a new role of phytochrome in mediating germination responses to seasonal cues and thereby identified for the first time a gene involved in maternal environmental effects on germination. We examined the germination responses of a mutant, hy2-1, which is deficient in the phytochrome chromophore. The background genotype, Landsberg erecta (Ler), lacked dormancy in most treatments, while hy2-1 required cold stratification for germination in a manner that resembled a more dormant ecotype, Columbia (Col). Unlike Col, hy2-1 was not induced into dormancy by warm stratification. Therefore, the down-regulation of phytochrome-mediated germination pathways results in sensitivity to cold, but we found no evidence that reduced phytochrome activity enables the warm-induction of dormancy. Cool temperatures during seed maturation induced dormancy. The hy2-1 mutants did not overcome this dormancy, indicating that phytochrome-mediated pathways are required to break cold-induced dormancy. Ler did not respond to post-stratification temperature, but hy2-1 did respond, suggesting phytochrome pathways are involved in germination responses to temperature. In summary, phytochromes mediate dormancy and germination responses to seasonal cues experienced both during seed maturation and after dispersal. Phytochromes therefore appear to be involved in mediating seasonal germination timing, a trait of great ecological importance and one that is under strong natural selection." ;

Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we provide evidence that phytochrome-mediated germination pathways simultaneously respond to light and temperature cues in ways that affect germination. Phytochrome mutant seeds were sown on agar plates and allowed to germinate in lit, growth chambers across a range of temperatures (7 degrees C to 28 degrees C). phyA had an important role in promoting germination at warmer temperatures, phyE was important to germination at colder temperatures and phyB was important to germination across a range of temperatures. Different phytochromes were required for germination at different temperatures, indicating a restriction or even a potential specialization of individual phytochrome activity as a function of temperature. This temperature-dependent activity of particular phytochromes reveals a potentially novel role for phytochrome pathways in regulating the seasonal timing of germination." ;

Three types of actors emerge: \"stars\" who have large loose-knit networks of bridge ties, \"invisible collegians\" who inhabit small dense cliques, and \"strugglers\" who have difficulty maintaining any sort of foothold in the network. Critical reviews of the photographers in the population are then analyzed for stylistic references, and the photographers are matched to stylistic categories. A match emerges between the types of networks and the stylistic perceptions of the critics. \"Stars\" are categorized with a wide variety of stylistic terms, often contradictory in nature. \"Invisible collegians\" and \"strugglers\" are routinely fit into one stylistic camp or another. Multiplying the person by style matrix by its transpose yields a person-by-person matrix of perceived shared stylistic affinity. \"Stars\" in this matrix have higher scores of both degree and \"betweenness\" centrality.

    schema:about "The Fosdick migmatitegranite complex in West Antarctica records evidence for two high-temperature metamorphic events, the first during the DevonianCarboniferous and the second during the Cretaceous. The conditions of each high-temperature metamorphic event, both of which involved melting and multiple melt-loss events, are investigated using phase equilibria modelling during successive melt-loss events, microstructural observations and mineral chemistry. In situ SHRIMP monazite and TIMS SmNd garnet ages are integrated with these results to constrain the timing of the two events. In areas that preferentially preserve the DevonianCarboniferous (M1) event, monazite grains in leucosomes and core domains of monazite inclusions in Cretaceous cordierite yield an age of c. 346 Ma, which is interpreted to record the timing of monazite growth during peak M1 metamorphism (similar to 820-870 degrees C, 7.511.5 kbar) and the formation of garnetsillimanitebiotitemelt-bearing assemblages. Slightly younger monazite spot ages between c. 331 and 314 Ma are identified from grains located in fractured garnet porphyroblasts, and from inclusions in plagioclase that surround relict garnet and in matrix biotite. These ages record the growth of monazite during garnet breakdown associated with cooling from peak M1 conditions. The Cretaceous (M2) overprint is recorded in compositionally homogeneous monazite grains and rim domains in zoned monazite grains. This monazite yields a protracted range of spot ages with a dominant population between c. 111 and 96 Ma. Rim domains of monazite inclusions in cordierite surrounding garnet and in coarse-grained poikiloblasts of cordierite yield a weighted mean age of c. 102 Ma, interpreted to constrain the age of cordierite growth. TIMS SmNd ages for garnet are similar at 10-299 Ma. Mineral equilibria modelling of the residual protolith composition after Carboniferous melt loss and removal of inert M1 garnet constrains M2 conditions to similar to 830-870 degrees C and similar to 67.5 kbar. The modelling results suggest that there was growth and resorption of garnet during the M2 event, which would facilitate overprinting of M1 compositions during the M2 prograde metamorphism. Measured garnet compositions and SmNd diffusion modelling of garnet in the migmatitic gneisses suggest resetting of major elements and the SmNd system during the Cretaceous M1 overprint. The c. 10299 Ma garnet SmNd closure ages correspond to cooling below 700 degrees C during the rapid exhumation of the Fosdick migmatitegranite complex." ;

We used this opportunity to test the hypothesis that self-monitoring would predict how and when voters, particularly independents who may be less likely to use political party affiliation as their primary criteria, decide which candidate to support. Results showed that high self-monitors rated information that was indicative of social consensus as more important to their decisions than did low self-monitors, especially if the information source reflected the opinion of an identifiable individual, not simply aggregate data. As predicted, high self-monitors also took longer to decide which candidate to support than did low-self monitors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed." ;

    schema:about "On the popular game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire men appear to average higher winnings than women. This article investigates potential reasons, including different uses of information sources (lifelines) and different perceptions of risk. We analyzed the decisions and resultant winnings of 164 contestants (95 men and 69 women) over 42 episodes of the show. Gender-based tests of Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory demonstrated evidence of gender differences in the certainty effect and suggested the counterintuitive conclusion that men are rewarded for acting slightly more cautiously than do women. These gender differences may be owing to self-selection of contestants, particularly for women, and to different goals: whereas men play to maximize their winnings, women may be less concerned with profit than with the experience as a whole. These findings suggest that examination of gender-related behavior in other risky, high-profile contexts may be worthwhile." ;

    schema:about "Trade-offs can exist within and across environments, and constrain evolutionary trajectories. To examine the effects of competition and resource availability on trade-offs, we grew individuals of recombinant inbred lines of Impatiens capensis in a factorial combination of five densities with two light environments (full light and neutral shade) and used a Bayesian logistic growth analysis to estimate intrinsic growth rates. To estimate across-environment constraints, we developed a variance decomposition approach to principal components analysis, which accounted for sample size, model-fitting, and within-RIL variation prior to eigenanalysis. We detected negative across-environment genetic covariances in intrinsic growth rates, although only under full-light. To evaluate the potential importance of these covariances, we surveyed natural populations of I. capensis to measure the frequency of different density environments across space and time. We combined our empirical estimates of across-environment genetic variance-covariance matrices and frequency of selective environments with hypothetical (yet realistic) selection gradients to project evolutionary responses in multiple density environments. Selection in common environments can lead to correlated responses to selection in rare environments that oppose and counteract direct selection in those rare environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the frequency of selective environments and the across-environment genetic covariances in traits simultaneously.

    schema:about "Using a 30 day time series of aphid Aphis helianthi and coccinellid counts on 107 mapped racemes of Yucca glauca, we demonstrate progressive, predation-induced self-organization of aphid colonies on individual racemes into extremely low and extremely high population sizes. This was driven by a two-attractor structure of density dependence that developed only in the presence of coccinellid predators. Foraging movements of the coccinellids among plants produced a power law relationship (average power = 0.142) between aphid and coccinellid numbers. This resulted in increased predation pressure on mid-size colonies and decreased predation pressure on small and large populations. A field-parameterized mathematical model predicts a two-attractor structure in broad agreement with our observations. The overall system was integrated by the influence of the largest aphid populations, which determined the total number of coccinellids present, and thus the predation pressure throughout the system. Our study provides clear evidence of predator-driven self-organization of prey populations in a patchy environment." ;

We introduce constant market share analysis, typically used only in international trade theory, offer a new extension to this tool, and conclude that industrial shifts have accounted for almost half the regional inversion among states.

Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 00(0):000-000. 1-12. DOI: 10.1111/jawr.12005 Abstract: In Colorado's Arkansas River basin, urban growth and harsh farming conditions have resulted in water transfers from agricultural to urban uses. Several studies have shown that these transfers have significant secondary economic impacts associated with the removal of irrigated land from production. In response, new methods of sharing water are being developed to allow water transfers that benefit both farm and urban economies, compared with previous permanent transfers that negatively impacted surrounding farm communities. One such project currently under development is the Arkansas Valley Super Ditch, which is a rotational crop fallowing plan based on long-term water leasing designed to provide an annual supply of 25,000 acre-feet of water (31.6Mm3). This article analyzes the net benefits of implementing the Super Ditch for both the farmers and the surrounding community." ;

Water rights markets help improve water allocation, allowing states to derive the highest economic benefit from available resources, and supporting new uses and economic development. However, the implicit (marginal) prices of water rights attributes are uncertain. To address this problem, we apply econometric analysis to a unique dataset to estimate the implicit values that market participants place on the attributes of shares of ditch company water rights in Colorado's South Platte River Basin. Our analysis demonstrates that ditch company share buyers value proximity of water diversion, reliability of water deliveries, and temporal flexibility of water use. To assess reliability we introduce the use of the coefficient of variation to capture, in one variable, the randomness of supply from ditch company shares that are not a single water right, but a portfolio of rights with different appropriation dates. Finally, we test and correct for spatial autocorrelation for the first time in a study of water market prices." ;

In our study area (central Texas), cave-inhabiting members of the subgenus Ceuthophilus are trogloxenes, roosting in the caves but foraging above ground and occasionally moving between caves, whereas members of the subgenus Geotettix are near-obligate cave dwellers, which forage inside the caves, and only rarely are found above ground. Differences in potential dispersal ability and ecology provide a framework for understanding their effects on the phylogeographical structure and isolation of populations of cave dwelling organisms. LocationEdwards Plateau, Texas, USA. MethodsWe sequenced 1263bp of two mitochondrial genes for a total of 309 individual rhaphidophorid cave crickets primarily in two subgenera of Ceuthophilus (Rhaphidophoridae). We reconstructed phylogenetic trees for each subgenus using Bayesian inference and then assessed whether their recent evolutionary history exhibited patterns of geographical structure. ResultsBoth Ceuthophilus and Geotettix exhibited strong geographical structure. Rather than exhibiting the expected lower levels of divergence and genetic structure, the trogloxenes of the subgenus Ceuthophilus show deeper divergences than the more cave-limited Geotettix taxa. Ceuthophilus has a higher proportion of unique haplotypes than does Geotettix. Mismatch distributions of Ceuthophilus and Geotettix differ, with Ceuthophilus exhibiting a multimodal mismatch distribution and Geotettix exhibiting a unimodal mismatch distribution. Main conclusionsBoth cave cricket subgenera display strong geographical structuring. However, their phylogenetic trees differed in their geographical orientation, which could be explained by timing of colonization, association with caves and underground connections, and above-ground landscape or ecological barriers. For Ceuthophilus, the relatively high proportion of unique haplotypes and the multimodal mismatch distribution are consistent with relatively larger population size as compared to Geotettix." ;

We present a particular Robertson-Walker metric (an empty universe metric) for which a coordinate transformation shows that none of these interpretation necessarily holds. The resulting paradoxes of interpretation lead to a deeper understanding of the meaning of the cosmological metric.

    schema:about "A new distributed sensor for detecting pressure variations caused by distant sources has been developed. The instrument reduces noise due to air turbulence in the infrasound band by averaging pressure along a line by means of monitoring strain in a long tubular diaphragm with an optical fiber interferometer. Above 1 Hz, the optical fiber infrasound sensor (OFIS) is less noisy than sensors relying on mechanical filters. Records collected from an 89-m-long OFIS indicate a new low noise limit in the band from 1 to 10 Hz. Because the OFIS integrates pressure variations at light-speed rather than the speed of sound, phase delays of the acoustical signals caused by the sensor are negligible. Very long fiber-optic sensors are feasible and hold the promise of better wind-noise reduction than can be achieved with acoustical-mechanical systems. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society, of America." ;

    schema:about "The nature of the physiology and thermal regulation of the nonavian dinosaurs is the subject of debate. Previously, arguments have been made for both endothermic and ectothermic metabolisms on the basis of differing methodologies. We used clumped isotope thermometry to determine body temperatures from the fossilized teeth of large Jurassic sauropods. Our data indicate body temperatures of 36 degrees to 38 degrees C, which are similar to those of most modern mammals. This temperature range is 4 degrees to 7 degrees C lower than predicted by a model that showed scaling of dinosaur body temperature with mass, which could indicate that sauropods had mechanisms to prevent excessively high body temperatures being reached because of their gigantic size." ;

    schema:about "The oxygen isotope composition (delta(18)O) of apatite from mammalian tooth enamel can be used to infer the delta(18)O value of ingested water, which is in turn related to that of precipitation stored in surface reservoirs. Therefore, the delta(18)O value of phosphate from fossil tooth enamel can be used to infer the delta(18)O value of these reservoirs in the past. In this paper, tooth enamel from a semiaquatic mammal taxon (Coryphodon) collected from five early Eocene localities in North America is used to construct patterns in delta(18)O values of river water for this time period. At all localities, the delta(18)O value of river water (delta(18)O(r)) is estimated to have been higher during the early Eocene relative to present-day North American rivers, although the delta(18)O vs. latitude gradient was shallower during the Eocene. Higher delta(18)O(r) values are consistent with warmer Eocene air masses being able to hold more water vapor and with an increase in the poleward transport of both moisture and latent heat. The regular decrease in delta(18)O(r) with latitude indicates that global atmospheric circulation patterns and hydrological transport were not much different from those of the present, although the shallower delta(18)O vs. latitude gradient during the Eocene may reflect regional differences in precipitation, evaporation, and river recharge. At a more regional scale, the delta(18)O value of river water can provide insight into topographic relief during the early Eocene. In the case of intermontane basins of Wyoming, differences in average delta(18)O(r) values between basins indicate that Laramide mountain relief was on the order of 475 m. It is suggested that anomalously low delta(18)O(r) values reported previously do not provide unambiguous evidence for permanent snow at higher elevations and may instead reflect brief episodes of cooler winters and/or altered atmospheric circulation patterns." ;

Among the best deep time laboratories to assess biotic impacts of Arctic climate change, early Eocene (ca. 53 Ma ago) fossil assemblages on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut (similar to 79 degrees N), preserve evidence of forests inhabited by alligators, tortoises, and a diverse mammalian fauna most similar to coeval lower-latitude faunas in western North America. By analyzing carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of mammalian tooth enamel, we show that large herbivores were year-round inhabitants in the Arctic, a probable prerequisite to dispersal across northern high-latitude land bridges. If present-day warming continues, year-round occupation of the Arctic by lower-latitude plants and animals is predicted." ;

    schema:about "The upward transfer of partially molten crust and the formation of gneiss domes and metamorphic core complexes commonly take place by localization of normal or oblique extension in the middle and upper crust. In Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, a transition from wrench to oblique extension occurred during oblique plate divergence along the East Gondwana margin and intracontinental crustal extension associated with the West Antarctic Rift System in mid-Cretaceous time. Migmatites in the Fosdick dome record steep fabrics formed during wrenching, and associated granite networks display crystallization ages of 117-115 Ma. These steep fabrics are overprinted by subhorizontal foliation and leucogranite sheets with crystallization ages in the 109-102 Ma range. Syntectonic emplacement of granite sheets in the South Fosdick detachment zone indicates that detachment tectonics led to rapid exhumation of the terrain by 100 Ma. This study has implications for understanding melt transport, magma accumulation, and the formation of detachments in an oblique tectonic setting." ;

    schema:about "In the Wet Mountains of central Colorado, we document evidence for increasing metamorphic grade and associated higher amounts of partial melting along a transect from northwest to southeast. Field observations of structural orientation and style, qualitative assessment of strain intensity, analysis of metamorphic mineral assemblages, and macroscopic identification of leucosomes and migmatites are complemented by the use of melt microstructures to carefully document the presence and locations of former partial melt and to identify melt-producing reactions. In the northwest Wet Mountains, migmatitic foliation is moderately well developed, and partial melting occurred via granite wet melting and muscovite-dehydration melting, with rare melt pseudomorphs remaining. At Dawson Mountain in the central part of the range, inferred former melt channels are preserved along grain and subgrain boundaries, deformation appears more intense, and anatexis occurred through biotite-dehydration melting. Farthest to the south, the highest intensity of strain is inferred, with very closely spaced foliations, abundant dynamic recrystallization, and local mylonitization occurring in rocks of granitic composition, and partial melting occurring via granite wet melting. Metapelitic rocks experienced biotite-dehydration melting and contain garnet with Mn-rich rims and Mn-poor cores mantled by plagioclase, decussate biotite, and quartz, textures indicating back-reaction between melt and garnet. These textures indicate there was abundant melt within these highest-grade rocks and extensive melt-rock interaction. Throughout the Wet Mountains, deformation is concentrated in areas where melt-producing reactions occurred, and melt appears to be localized along deformation-related features, suggesting a correlation between partial melting and deformation. The northern Wet Mountains contain few plutons, whereas the central and southern portions of the Wet Mountains contain more pervasive dikes and sills and may contain more former melt as a result of both higher metamorphic grade and widespread thermal insulation. The Wet Mountains represent an exhumed section of formerly molten middle crust located at the transition between upper and lower crust and provide insight into processes ongoing at depth in modern oro-genic belts. The microstructures indicative of former partial melt, textures associated with melt-rock interaction, and melting reactions we have identified in the Wet Mountains will greatly facilitate the recognition of other such exhumed sections." ;

    schema:about "Detrital zircon provenance analysis is used to resolve the age of sandstone injectites together with source sandstones that form fault-bounded, tabular bodies within Mesoproterozoic crystalline rocks of the Colorado Front Range. Named Tava sandstone (informal), the unit is a product of liquefaction and remobilization of mature quartz sediment within source bodies having volumes >= 1 x 10(6) m(3) into dikes up to 6 m in width. To surmount the indeterminate age of emplacement, we obtained new U-Pb detrital zircon age data for two source sandstones, three dikes and one sill, for comparison to four Paleozoic arenites. Tava age distributions feature a dominant 1.33-0.97 Ga broad age group and narrow ca. 1.11, 1.44, and 1.70 Ga groups, with several smaller age groups >1.5 Ga. The Tava detrital zircon results are dissimilar to Paleozoic sandstones but closely resemble published detrital zircon reference data for Grenville orogen-derived siliciclastic units of the western United States. The similarity in age distributions is borne out by statistical comparisons among Tava sandstone, Paleozoic samples, and Neoproterozoic strata that reveal a high probability of correlation of Tava sandstone to ca. 800-680 Ma strata deposited during intrac-ontinental extension. We conclude that Tava sandstone is Neoproterozoic in age and provides a new avenue to investigation of Rodinia's terrestrial paleoenvironment." ;

    schema:about "In the Wet Mountains, Colorado, Proterozoic rocks exposed along an oblique north-south tilted section preserve evidence of regional deformation and high temperature metamorphism in the middle and lower crust at ca. 1435-1365 Ma. Deformation of gneisses in the northern Wet Mountains is partitioned within discrete zones of subvertical foliation and northeast-trending folds, a product of northwest-southeast contraction or constriction associated with transcurrent deformation. Gneisses in the north are generally not migmatitic, and granitic intrusions form discrete bodies with distinct contacts. Shear zone foliation is cut by a late syntectonic dike with a U-Pb zircon age of 1430+5/-3 Ma, constraining the age of shear zone deformation in the upper crust. In the central to southern Wet Mountains, gneisses exhibit migmatitic foliation that dips moderately northeast, with dip-to oblique-slip mineral lineation throughout. Granite forms pervasive sills and interconnected sheets with gradational or indistinct contacts. Gneissic granite that yields a U-Pb zircon age of 1435 +/- 4 Ma was emplaced into amphibolite gneiss containing 1436 +/- 2 Ma metamorphic zircon. Younger, foliated granite sills were emplaced at 1390 +/- 10 Ma. Our new results indicate contemporaneous deformation and metamorphism throughout the middle and lower crust at ca. 1.4 Ga. We interpret the zone of migmatitic crust pervaded by granite to represent a weak, low-viscosity, flowing lower crust that controlled the pattern of distributed deformation in the comparatively strong, brittle crust above. Thus, the Wet Mountains may be viewed as a deeply exhumed analog for the mid-crustal, low-viscosity layers that are inferred to exist in modern intracontinental orogenic settings and continental rift provinces." ;

    schema:about "Symbiotic fungi's role in providing nitrogen to host plants is well-studied in tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, but little-studied in the adjoining boreal forest ecosystem. Along a 570 km north-south transect from the Yukon River to the North Slope of Alaska, the N-15 content was strongly reduced in ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants including Betula, Salix, Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B. S. P., Picea glauca Moench (Voss), and ericaceous plants. Compared with the N-15 content of soil, the foliage of nonmycorrhizal plants (Carex and Eriophorum) was unchanged, whereas content of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was very much higher (e. g., Boletaceae, Leccinum and Cortinarius). It is hypothesized that similar processes operate in tundra and boreal forest, both nitrogen-limited ecosystems: (i) mycorrhizal fungi break down soil polymers and take up amino acids or other nitrogen compounds; (ii) mycorrhizal fungi fractionate against N-15 during production of transfer compounds; (iii) host plants are accordingly depleted in N-15; and (iv) mycorrhizal fungi are enriched in N-15. Increased N availability for plant roots or decreased light availability to understory plants may have decreased N allocation to mycorrhizal partners and increased delta N-15 by 3 parts per thousand-4 parts per thousand for southern populations of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. and Salix. Fungal biomass, measured as ergosterol, correlated strongly with soil organic matter and attained amounts similar to those in temperate forest soils." ;

It confirms recent scholarship regarding the role of local interpersonal networks in early rural mobilization, which in this context required infiltration of local, religio-magical popular militias called Red Spear societies. It then examines popular and party-constructed representations of the revolt, illustrating both the function of early CCP propaganda within rural popular culture and its implications for official historiography, which practiced specific forms of erasure in representing popular collective memory. It uses party documents, memoirs, and local histories to show that the historical significance of the Queshan uprising resides less in the failed revolt itself than in the ways its legacy was appropriated by cadres and historians during the twentieth century." ;

    schema:about "Research suggests that posture exerts powerful affective and cognitive influences, although recent studies have indicated that these embodiment effects are moderated by gender. We examined two sociocultural factors that may contribute to the effects of postural feedback in women: self-objectification and power. Across a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects design, 80 female undergraduates completed various cognitive tasks and self-report measures after having been in an upright or slouched posture, seated in either a (powerful) throne or child's chair, and wearing either a formfitting (objectifying) tank top or loose sweatshirt. The results showed that posture had the predicted influence on mood, with those seated upright reporting more positive mood than those seated in a slouched position. For the cognitive tasks, our findings were more complex and, due to low power, are best considered preliminary. Participants who were seated upright in a child's chair while wearing a sweatshirt attempted the highest number of math items compared to those in the other conditions, supporting our prediction that postural benefits would be greatest in a context where power cues were gender-appropriate and self-objectification effects were attenuated. On a measure of satisfaction with performance, our findings suggest that self-objectification outweighed the power manipulation, leading to poorer outcomes when a seated position emphasized sexualized features of the body. Taken together, our results suggest that embodiment effects appear to be impacted by contextual cues, perhaps particularly for women." ;

    schema:about "Reviews the book, One Marriage Under God: The Campaign to Promote Marriage in America by Melanie Heath (2012). This book aims to promote the heterosexual marriage as a primary solution to the problem of poverty in the United States. The book is too complicated to summarize briefly, but perhaps some description of the organization will give a sense of the project. The book is highly recommended I high, in whole or in part, for use in a variety of classes, including those focused on gender. The government and religious prescription of traditional marriage as the cure for poverty has important gender implications, which could be unpacked using this book. The book makes for interesting analysis on numerous levels, and Heath does a great job of making a multifaceted social phenomenon, not uncomplicated, but clear.

Our purpose is to study the spread of cooperative or non-cooperative behavior over time in populations playing a 3-person centipede game by manipulating the behavior of the robots (cooperative vs. non-cooperative) and their proportion in the population. Our results convey a positive message: adding a handful of cooperative robots increases the propensity of the genuine subjects to cooperate over time, whereas adding a handful of non-cooperative agents does not decrease this propensity. If there are enough hard-core cooperative subjects in the population, they not only negate the behavior of the non-cooperative robots but also induce other subjects to behave more cooperatively.

    schema:about "This article demonstrates theoretically that, given a casual relationship exists from league parity to fan interest, as large-market teams myopically outbid small-market teams for talent there is potential for league parity to be underprovided. In this model, league parity is treated as a public good. With this characterization, this article arrives at the familiar economic result that public goods tend to be underprovided. This article does not discuss the impact of declining league parity intertemporally. Intuition suggests this decline could hamper interest in the league sport and even lead to a smaller fan base. The results suggest that if league parity is an important determinant of fan interest, a league lump-sum payment (transfer) and tax (subsidy) system may result in higher league profits. The article does add as a caveat that the authors are in no way justifying the revenue sharing plan adopted by Major League Baseball or any other league." ;

    schema:about "To begin with, the essay identifies shortcomings in classical suture theory's approach to film's narration of consciousness. This approach, which has been widely influential in film theory, grew out of work by Jean-Pierre Oudart, Jacques-Alain Miller, Daniel Dayan, Stephen Heath, and Kaja Silverman and emphasizes a Lacanian drama of absence. This model of suture has also been the focus of important criticism by scholars like David Bordwell and Noel Carroll. My alternative paradigm of embodiment and multiple consciousnesses, what I call deep intersubjectivity, emerges from Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology, with contributions from Oudart's own phenomenological observations, and seeks to return the body (including its politics) to suture and to film narrative. The fundamental image drawn from Merleau-Ponty is the chiasmus, the film version of which is the shot/reverse shot sequence. I conclude with close readings of two moments from Michael Roemer's 1964 film about African American life, Nothing but a Man: they illustrate how suture enables the narration of intersubjectivity in film, in its embodiments (including the political) from violation and humiliation to evasion, opacity, and sometimes a recuperation, even if incomplete, of community, however temporary or partial." ;

    schema:about "Strict spatial and temporal regulation of proliferation and differentiation is essential for proper germline development and often involves soma/germline interactions. In C. elegans, a particularly striking outcome of defective regulation of the proliferation/differentiation pattern is the Pro phenotype in which an ectopic mass of proliferating germ cells occupies the proximal adult germ line, a region normally occupied by gametes. We describe a reduction-of-function mutation in the gene pro-1 that causes a highly penetrant Pro phenotype. The pro-1 mutant Pro phenotype stems from defects in the time and position of the first meiotic entry during early germline development. pro-1(RNAi) produces a loss of somatic gonad structures and concomitant reduction in germline proliferation and gametogenesis. pro-1 encodes a member of a highly conserved subfamily of WD-repeat proteins. pro-1(+) is required in the sheath/spermatheca lineage of the somatic gonad in its role in the proper establishment of the proliferation/differentiation pattern in the germline. Our results provide a handle for further analysis of this soma-to-germline interaction.

    schema:about "RNA structures contain many bulges and loops that are expected to be sites for inter- and intra-molecular interactions. Nucleotides in the bulge are expected to influence the structure and recognition of RNA. The same stability is assigned to all trinucleotide bulged RNA in the current secondary structure prediction models. In this study thermal denaturation experiments were performed on four trinucleotide bulged RNA, in the context of HIV-1 TAR RNA, to determine whether the bulge sequence affects RNA stability and its divalent ion interactions. Cytosine-rich bulged RNA were more stable than uracil-rich bulged RNA in 1 M KCl. Interactions of divalent ions were more favorable with uracil-rich bulged RNA by similar to 2 kcal/mol over cytosine-rich bulged RNA. The UCU-TAR RNA (wild type) is stabilized by 1.7 kcal/mol in 9.5 mM Ca(2+) as compared with 1 M KCl, whereas no additional gain in stability is measured for CCC-TAR RNA. These results have implications for base substitution experiments traditionally employed to identify metal ion binding sites. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to quantify the effect of small sequence changes on RNA stability upon interactions with divalent ions." ;

    schema:about "Riboswitches are functional mRNA that control gene expression. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) binds to thi-box riboswitch RNA and allosterically inhibits genes that code for proteins involved in the biosynthesis and transport of thiamine. Thiamine binding to the pyrimidine sensor helix and pyrophosphate binding to the pyrophosphate sensor helix cause changes in RNA conformation that regulate gene expression. Here we examine the thermodynamic properties of the internal loop of the pyrophosphate binding domain by comparing the wild-type construct (RNA WT) with six modified 2 x 2 bulged RNA and one 2 x 2 bulged DNA. The wild-type construct retains five conserved bases of the pyrophosphate sensor domain, two of which are in the 2 x 2 bulge (C65 and G66). The RNA WT construct was among the most stable (Delta G degrees(37) = -7.7 kcal/mol) in 1 M KCl at pH 7.5. Breaking the A center dot G mismatch of the bulge decreases the stability of the construct similar to 0.5-1 kcal/mol, but does not affect magnesium binding to the RNA WT. Guanine at position 48 is important for RNA-Mg(2+) interactions of the TPP-binding riboswitch at pH 7.5. In the presence of 9.5 mM magnesium at pH 5.5, the bulged RNA constructs gained an average of 1.1 kcal/mol relative to 1 M salt. Formation of a single A+center dot C mismatch base pair contributes about 0.5 kcal/mol at pH 5.5, whereas two tandem A+center dot C mismatch base pairs together contribute about 2 kcal/mol." ;

Jessie Fauset and Paulette Nardal have been described as 'midwives' of the Harlem Renaissance and Negritude movements respectively, despite the fact that they were racial activists and prolific writers in a variety of genres themselves. Focusing on the tropes of dislocation, (mis)translation, and (mis)representation as they interact with the imaginary of Paris between the wars, the author sees the work of both African-American and Francophone black women writers as central to the creation of Afromodernisms and twentieth-century feminisms. Afromodernist women map interwar Paris, and, by extension, the relationship between the Americas, Europe, and Africa differently to their male colleagues, as the interaction between the black female body and the actual and imaginary spaces it negotiates are quite distinct from the male. Reading the work of Fauset, Nardal, and their contemporaries Gwendolyn Bennett, Jane Nardal, Suzanne Lacascade, Anita Thompson Dickinson and Suzanne Cï¿½saire, shows us that a black feminist modernism was emerging in discourses that circulated through Paris, Harlem, and the Antilles. This feminism constitutes a significant aspect of the 'ï¿½veil de conscience du race' that characterized the New Negro and Negritude movements. Understanding that their work and thought are more than footnotes to a patriarchal genealogy of black liberation movements helps us to appreciate more richly this perennially fascinating and influential era. Cet article ï¿½tudie les vies et les ï¿½uvres des deux ï¿½crivaines qui habitaient ï¿½ Paris entre les guerres mondiales. Ensemble, les ï¿½critures du Jessie Fauset et Paulette Nardal offrent un exemple d'un fï¿½minisme noir et moderniste qu'on voit aussi dans les ï¿½uvres des ï¿½crivaines contemporaines comme Gwendolyn Bennett, Anita Thompson Dickinson, Suzanne Lacascade, et Suzanne Cï¿½saire. Les femmes afromodernistes retracent une carte de Paris et, par extension, les relations du triangle Atlantique, dans une mode qui est distinguï¿½e de celle de ses contemporains masculins En se concentrant sur les tropes de la dislocation, les erreurs de traduction et problï¿½mes de la reprï¿½sentation dans leurs interactions avec l'imaginaire Parisienne, l'auteur montre que les ï¿½critures des femmes afro-amï¿½ricaines et francophones ï¿½taient centrales ï¿½ la crï¿½ation d'un modernisme noir et des fï¿½minismes du 20e siï¿½cle. Si l'on transplante le problï¿½me liï¿½ ï¿½ l'ï¿½criture sur le genre au centre de notre comprï¿½hension du discours moderniste sur la race, alors on constate qu'il existe un engagement innovateur dans lequel les questions concernant le genre sont aussi intimement intï¿½grï¿½es aux discours sur le 'New Negro' et sur la Nï¿½gritude que la critique sur la 'race', la suprï¿½matie blanche et le colonialisme. Par consï¿½quent, les ï¿½vï¿½nements et les interactions dï¿½crits dans les gï¿½nï¿½alogies conventionnelles de ces mouvements deviennent moins figï¿½s et dï¿½terministes, ce qui permet aux rechercheurs d'entamer les discussions plus approfondies. Les fï¿½minismes noires qui ï¿½mergent pendent cette pï¿½riode importante dans l'histoire des mouvements anti-coloniales constituent un aspect signifiant mais oubliï¿½ de 'l'ï¿½veil de conscience du race' qui a contribuï¿½e ï¿½ la modernitï¿½ globale.

    schema:about "The large number of RNA-binding proteins and translation factors encoded in the Drosophila and other metazoan genomes predicts widespread use of post-transcriptional regulation in cellular and developmental processes. Previous studies identified roles for several RNA-binding proteins in dendrite branching morphogenesis of Drosophila larval sensory neurons. To determine the larger contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulation to neuronal morphogenesis, we conducted an RNA interference screen to identify additional Drosophila proteins annotated as either RNA-binding proteins or translation factors that function in producing the complex dendritic trees of larval class IV dendritic arborization neurons. We identified 88 genes encoding such proteins whose knockdown resulted in aberrant dendritic morphology, including alterations in dendritic branch number, branch length, field size, and patterning of the dendritic tree. In particular, splicing and translation initiation factors were associated with distinct and characteristic phenotypes, suggesting that different morphogenetic events are best controlled at specific steps in post-transcriptional messenger RNA metabolism. Many of the factors identified in the screen have been implicated in controlling the subcellular distributions and translation of maternal messenger RNAs; thus, common post-transcriptional regulatory strategies may be used in neurogenesis and in the generation of asymmetry in the female germline and embryo." ;

    schema:about "We report molecular genetic studies of three genes involved in early germ-line proliferation in Caenorhabditis elegans that lend unexpected insight into a germ-line/soma functional separation of autosomal/X-linked duplicated gene pairs. In a genetic screen for germ-line proliferation-defective mutants, we identified mutations in rpl-11.1 (L11 protein of the large ribosomal subunit), pab-1 a poly(A)-binding protein], and glp-3/eft-3 (an elongation factor 1-a homolog). All three are members of autosome/X gene pairs. Consistent with a germ-line-restricted function of rpl-11.1 and pab-1, mutations in these genes extend life span and cause gigantism. We further examined the RNAi phenotypes of the three sets of rpl genes (rpl-11, rpl-24, and rpl-25) and found that for the two rpl genes with autosomal/X-linked pairs (rpl-11 and rpl-25), zygotic germ-line function is carried by the autosomal copy. Available RNAi results for highly conserved autosomal/X-linked gene pairs suggest that other duplicated genes may follow a similar trend. The three rpl and the pab-1/2 duplications predate the divergence between C. elegans and C. briggsae, while the eft-3/4 duplication appears to have occurred in the lineage to C. elegans after it diverged from C. briggsae. The duplicated C. briggsae orthologs of the three C. elegans autosomal/X-linked gene pairs also display functional differences between paralogs. We present hypotheses for evolutionary mechanisms that may underlie germ-line/soma subfunctionalization of duplicated genes, taking into account the role of X chromosome silencing in the germ line and analogous mammalian phenomena.

    schema:about "Salamander species that live entirely in subterranean habitats have evolved adaptations that allow them to cope with perpetual darkness and limited energy resources. We conducted a 26-month mark-recapture study to better understand the individual growth and demography of a population of the Big Mouth Cave Salamander (Gyrinophilus palleucus necturoides). We employed a growth model to estimate growth rates, age at sexual maturity, and longevity, and an open population model to estimate population size, density, detectability, and survival rates. Furthermore, we examined cover use and evidence of potential predation. Individuals probably reach sexual maturity in 3-5 years and live at least nine years. Survival rates were generally high (>75%) but declined during the study. More than 30% of captured salamanders had regenerating tails or tail damage, which presumably represent predation attempts by conspecifics or crayfishes. Most salamanders (>90%) were found under cover (e.g., rocks, trash, decaying plant material). Based on 11 surveys during the study, population size estimates ranged from 21 to 104 individuals in the ca. 710 m(2) study area. Previous surveys indicated that this population experienced a significant decline from the early 1970s through the 1990s, perhaps related to silvicultural and agricultural practices. However, our data suggest that this population has either recovered or stabilized during the past 20 years. Differences in relative abundance between early surveys and our survey could be associated with differences in survey methods or sampling conditions rather than an increase in population size. Regardless, our study demonstrates that this population is larger than previously thought and is in no immediate risk of extirpation, though it does appear to exhibit higher rates of predation than expected for a species believed to be an apex predator of subterranean food webs." ;

    schema:about "Recent collecting in caves in the Ozark region of the USA produced a number of new scarab beetle records (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea). We report our collections and review literature records of scarabs reported from caves in the USA and Canada. Most of these records are accidental occurrences, but a few represent widespread species with known associations to host vertebrates that may occupy a cave. Two species, Onthophagus cavernicollis Howden and Cartwright (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), and Stenotothorax gardneri (Gordon) (Scarabaeidae: Aphodiinae), appear closely tied to woodrat, Neotoma floridana (Ord) (Rodentia: Cricetidae), nests. We consider the cave association of these two species, categorizing them as troglophiles. The distribution of O. cavernicollis is mainly in the Ozark region, but this pattern may be due to inadequate sampling in other locations. Stenotothorax gardneri is known only from caves in the Ozark region. All available collection records from recent work, museum specimens and literature accounts are presented for these species. Additional discussions are presented for O. cavernicollis because our materials contained the undescribed male and female minors and new insight into their habits." ;

We studied success of turf transplants 3 yr after transplanting on Mount Belford in the Sawatch Range, and Humboldt Peak in the Sangre de Cristo Range. Based on point-intercept data, sum of all vascular species' covers was 12% to 31% lower in transplanted plots than in control areas. We found no differences in canopy density and height between transplant and control plots on Mount Belford, while both were about 40% lower in transplants on Humboldt Peak. Species richness adjusted for plot size was slightly greater in transplant plots on Mount Belford and slightly lower on Humboldt Peak. On both peaks, we found greater absolute cover of grasses in transplant plots, while forb cover was lower. After 3 yr, turf transplants effectively established vegetation cover and maintained high species richness in these communities. Whenever turf is available, e.g., new trail construction, it should be used to restore closed social trails and campsites, and turf transplants can be considered in other ecosystems for small disturbances in high-value areas where restoration would otherwise be slow." ;

    schema:about "Questions related to dinosaur behavior can be difficult to answer conclusively by using morphological studies alone. As a complement to these approaches, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tooth enamel can provide insight into habitat and dietary preferences of herbivorous dinosaurs. This approach is based on the isotopic variability in plant material and in surface waters of the past, which is in turn reflected by carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of animals that ingested the organic matter or drank the water. Thus, it has the potential to identify and characterize dietary and habitat preferences for coexisting taxa. In this study, stable isotope ratios from coexisting hadrosaurian and ceratopsian dinosaurs of the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota are compared for four different stratigraphic levels. Isotopic offsets between tooth enamel and tooth dentine, as well as taxonomic differences in means and in patterns of isotopic data among taxa, indicate that primary paleoecological information is preserved. The existence of taxonomic offsets also provides the first direct evidence for dietary niche partitioning among these herbivorous dinosaur taxa. Of particular interest is the observation that the nature of this partitioning changes over time: for some localities ceratopsian dinosaurs have higher carbon and oxygen isotope ratios than hadrosaurs, indicating a preference for plants living in open settings near the coast, whereas for other localities isotope ratios are lower, indicating a preference for plants in the understory of forests. In most cases the isotope ratios among hadrosaurs are similar and are interpreted to represent a dietary preference for plants of the forest canopy. The inferred differences in ceratopsian behavior are suggested to represent a change in vegetation cover and hence habitat availability in response to sea level change or to the position of river distributaries. Given our current lack of taxonomic resolution, it is not possible to determine if dietary and habitat preferences inferred from stable isotope data are associated with single, or multiple, species of hadrosaurian/ceratopsian dinosaurs." ;

    schema:about "Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were measured for carbonate ill samples of hadrosaurid tooth enamel and dentine, and gar Scale ganoine and dentine from five geologically \"contemporaneous\" (two-million-year resolution) and geographically, distant late Campanian formations (Two Medicine, Dinosaur Park, Judith River, Kaiparowits, and Fruitland) in the Western Interior Basin. In all cases, isotopic offsets were observed between enamel and dentine from the same teeth, with dentine being characterized by higher and more variable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios. Isotopic offsets were also observed between gar ganoine and hadrosaur enamel in all sites analyzed. Both of these observations indicate that diagenetic overprinting of enamel isotope ratios did not entirely obfuscate primary signals. Decreases in carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were observed in hardosaur enamel from east to west, and overlap in isotope ratios occurred only between two of the sampled sites (Dinosaur Park and Judith River Formations). The lack of isotopic overlap for enamel among localities could be clue to diagenetic resetting of isotope ratios Such that they reflect local groundwater effects rather than primary biogenic inputs. However, the large range in carbon isotopic ratios, the consistent taxonomic effects for enamel/ganoine data, and comparisons of enamel-dentine data from the same teeth all suggest that diagenesis is not the lone driver of the signal. In the absence of major alteration, the mostly likely explanation for the isotopic patterns observed is that hadrosaurids from the targeted formations were eating plants and drinking water's with distinct isotopic ratios one implication of this reconstruction is that hadrosaurids in the Late Cretaceous of the Western Interior did not migrate to,ill extent that would obscure local isotopic signatures." ;

    schema:about "Cave invertebrate communities are dependent upon exogenous energy sources because their environment generally lacks primary producers. In small caves of central Texas, endemic terrestrial cave invertebrates often rely in part on the energy brought into caves by cave crickets (Ceuthophilus spp.), which forage above ground at night and roost in caves during the daytime. Knowledge of cave cricket foraging range is needed to effectively protect invertebrate communities that include federally endangered species. We marked approximately 2000 C. secretus emerging from Big Red Cave (Coryell County, Texas) with UV bright paint and located 291 previously marked crickets over 17 nights. Crickets foraged up to 105 m from the cave entrance and were present in relatively uniform densities out to 80 m. While 51.1% of the crickets were found within 40 m, 8.1% were found at 80 m or beyond. Relocated crickets were predominantly found in grasses (30.7%), leaf litter (22.4%) and herbaceous vegetation (20.4%) and were found close to ground level (mean = 0.49 cm). Our results show that C. secretus can forage at much greater distances than previously reported. The new data from our study should assist in the development of effective preserve design and management strategies for caves with endangered species in central Texas." ;

    schema:about "Tamarix ramosissima has caused dramatic morphological changes to riparian ecosystems and their bank structures over the last century throughout the southwestern United States. Growing as either small trees or dense stands of shoots, Tamarix species displace or actively outcompete native species of willow (Salix exigua) and cottonwood (Populus deltoides) on the Arkansas River in Colorado. Under normal conditions for colonization by native species, Tamarix seedlings are at a great competitive disadvantage due to slow above ground biomass accumulation. However, damming and the resulting altered disturbance regime may give Tamarix as advantage over native species. Damming on the Arkansas River, Colorado, dramatically reduces the intensity and recurrence interval of downstream flooding. Using two dams in eastern Colorado as proxies for flood control, we assessed physiological, demographic and abiotic factors in order to understand how flooding and damming might influence riparian community dynamics. Our study demonstrates that drought and salinity stress may influence native species recruitment and survival in areas with reduced flooding. Moreover, Tamarix water-use may be quite plastic in drought conditions, suggesting that it conserves water at below dam sites." ;

The author argues two principal points: 1) that shortcomings of focus groups can be offset by using them in conjunction with other research techniques, and 2) that when so employed, focus groups can potentially improve the depth, validity, and collaborative aspects of interpretivist ethnographic work in counter-intuitive ways." ;

    schema:about "Can choice of mutualistic partners and the degree of their utilization determine (1) mutualistic partner coexistence, (2) relative abundance of mutualistic partners, and (3) environment-dependent changes in relative abundance? We investigate these questions in the context of the plant-mycorrhizal fungal mutualism by building a biological market model potentially applicable to other mutualisms as well. We examine the situation where a single plant selectively utilizes member(s) of a group of ectomycorrhizal potential trading partners. Under biologically realistic circumstances, the plant may simultaneously utilize multiple partners, its degree of utilization determining the community structure of the fungi. If utilization of multiple partners is optimal, the marginal cost of acquiring additional nitrogen from every trading partner must be equal while the marginal cost of acquiring it from any unutilized partner must be larger. Because the plant's nitrogen demand is light dependent, the composition of the fungal species among its trading partners changes along light-availability gradients. We discuss the design of an experiment to test the key prediction of our model, the equalization of marginal cost." ;

    schema:about "Here we document the occurrence of locally common oncoids in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah in the Woodside Anticline area of the San Rafael Swell and use them to understand changes in the Early Cretaceous landscape and their effects on the dinosaur fauna. Detailed facies analysis is required to understand the context of these changes within the broader patterns of Mesozoic tectonics and the fossil record. Oncolite crops out in the Cedar Mountain Formation, directly overlying the Buckhorn Conglomerate. Oncolite is not widely distributed outside of the Woodside Anticline area. The oncoids are found in a bimodal population with the majority in the 2-5-cm-diameter range and a smaller population >25 cm in diameter. Nuclei are mostly rounded chert clasts and also include litharenite, polymict conglomerate, limestone, and both abraded and nonabraded dinosaur bone and wood fragments. Cortices are 3-5 mm thick with distinct, penecint (laminae that completely enclose a body; Hofmann, 1969), low-relief laminae. Some laminae are crenulated and comprise ministromatolites. The petrography of the oncoids suggests formation along lake margins where large fragments of reworked sedimentary clasts and dinosaur bones came to rest and were coated by bacterial mats. Caliche cements and coats some of the oncolite; these define a lake shoreline affected by fluctuating lake level. The isotope geochemistry indicates a combination of primary and diagenetic signals consistent with oncoid formation in open, ephemeral freshwater lakes." ;

    schema:about "Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to determine rare earth element (REE) content of 76 fossil bones collected front the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Two Medicine (TIME) and Judith River (JRF) Formations of Montana. REE content is distinctive at the formation scale, with TMF samples exhibiting generally higher overall REE content and greater variability in REE enrichment than JRF samples. Moreover, JRF bones exhibit relative enrichment in heavy REE, whereas TMF bones span heavy and light enrichment fields in roughly equal proportions. TMF bones are also characterized by more negative Ce anomalies and greater U enrichment than JRF bones, which is consistent with more oxidizing diagenetic conditions in the TMF. Bonebeds in both formations show general consistency in REE content, with no indication of spatial or temporal mixing within sites. Previous studies, however, suggest that the bonebeds in question are attritional assemblages that accumulated over considerable time spans. The absence of geochemical evidence for mixing is consistent with diagenesis transpiring in settings that remained chemically and hydrologically stable during recrystallization. Lithology-related patterns in REE content were also compared, and TMF bones recovered front fluvial sandstones show relative enrichment in heavy REE when compared with hones recovered front fine-grained floodplain deposits. In contrast, JRF bones, regardless of lithologic context (sandstone versus mudstone), exhibit similar patterns of REE uptake. This result is consistent with previous reconstructions that suggest that channel-hosted microfossil bonebeds of the JRF developed via the reworking of preexisting concentrations embedded in the interfluve. Geochemical data further indicate that reworked elements were potentially delivered to channels in a recrystallized condition, which is consistent with rapid adsorption of REE postmortem." ;

    schema:about "Robust isotopic reconstructions of climate, elevation, and biology require a reasonable capture of the range of isotopic variability across a paleolandscape. Here, we illustrate how integrating multiple proxies derived from a variety of paleoenvironments aids in this effort. We determined delta(18)O and delta(13)C values from lake and soil carbonates, unionid shells, gar scales, and crocodile teeth from multiple depositional environments (lakes, soils, ponds, streams, and large rivers) spanning a 300 km proximal-to-distal transect within the Late Cretaceous foreland basin of Montana. Two major patterns emerge. First, quiet water environments display higher delta(18)O and lower delta(13)C values than large rivers, which indicates greater input from local precipitation compared to high-altitude runoff, and a relatively larger contribution of degraded vegetative matter to the dissolved inorganic carbon load. Second, proxies with seasonal biases toward late spring and summer growth display lower delta(18)O and delta(13)C values in the basin proximal setting compared to the distal coastal setting, which is linked to the rainout history of vapor masses moving across the foreland basin. Overall these isotopic patterns mirror those in modern catchments, support hypotheses of monsoonal rainfall within the basin, and suggest a hypsometric mean elevation of similar to 2.6 km within the Sevier orogenic belt. Furthermore, our results indicate a potential to subdivide freshwater paleoecosystems to refine paleobiologic studies of habitat preference and migration patterns." ;

Initially melt collects in grain boundaries before migrating along structural fabrics and through discordant fractures initiated during synanatectic deformation. As this permeable porosity develops, melt flows down gradients in pressure generated by the imposed tectonic stress, moving from grain boundaries through outcrop-scale vein networks to ascent conduits. Gravity then drives melt ascent through the crust, either in dikes that fill ductile-to-brittle-elastic fractures or by pervasive flow in planar and linear channels in belts of steep structural fabrics. Melt may be arrested in its ascent at the ductile-to-brittle transition zone or it may be trapped en route by a developing tectonic structure." ;

Recovery was slow, probably due to poor seedling survival. Covers of vascular plants and lichens were much lower on denuded plots than on controls except in late-melting snowbanks where natural disturbance by pocket gophers may have selected for disturbance-adapted species. Moister communities generally regained cover faster than drier communities. Vegetative expansion from plot edges provided most cover, although some colonizers originated from seed. Kobresia myosuroides, previously unknown to reproduce sexually in the Southern Rocky Mountains, occasionally colonized by seed. Essentially all vascular species acted as both colonizers and components of mature vegetation, and the vast majority of species are present in similar relative frequencies in control and disturbed plots. Previously studied alpine sites show either a similar lack of differentiation of early- and late-successional species or higher relative abundance of grasses in disturbed sites. In contrast to vegetation recovery in most temperate ecosystems, in these small plots on Niwot Ridge sequential replacement of species after disturbance does not occur." ;

This area was revegetated in summer 1997 by transplanting pieces of turf cut from a new trail. For both transplants and controls, 100 points were sampled in seventeen 70 X 70 cm plots. Vascular plant species richness did not differ between transplant and control plots. Thirty-one species showed absolute covers not significantly different between transplant and control plots, and twelve species had higher covers in control plots or showed a strong trend in that direction. Sums of covers of all species declined by 35% in transplant plots. Transplant and control plots had differential relative success of some important species as measured by relative cover although almost all differences were small. Grasses increased moderately and forbs declined by 9%. Relative cover of the dominant. Geum rossii, as well as two common graminoids, Carex phaeocephala and Trisetum spicatum, decreased in transplant plots. The forbs Polygonum bistortoides and Potentilla subjuga increased in relative cover in transplant plots, one of the dominant species. Carex elynoides, and many secondary species, were not different between treatments.

    schema:about "Empirical estimates of climate parameters such as mean annual temperature (MAT) are essential to describe both ancient climate and to ground truth climate model simulations of past climates. In terrestrial settings, no single proxy record is able to provide detailed temporal yet geographically widespread information, and it thus becomes essential that paleoclimatic information obtained from different proxies be comparable. As an example of how to compare estimates, and to illustrate what can be learned by doing so, we measured oxygen isotope ratios of phosphate in the tooth enamel of fossil mammals and the body scales of freshwater fish in order to estimate the mean annual temperature (MAT) in which they lived. The samples were collected from Paleogene rocks of the Bighorn, Green River, and Powder River basins of Wyoming. Earliest Eocene samples provide MAT estimates that are similar to MAT estimates for the same times and areas obtained from leaf margin analysis. Furthermore, isotopic data from the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which has not yet yielded fossil floras, indicate a significantly higher MAT of 26degreesC. We also used temperature estimates obtained by both methods to investigate paleoelevation and to reconstruct geographic patterns of MAT over North America for the early Eocene. Larger Laramide basins have higher temperatures and lower inferred elevations compared to associated volcanic highlands where cooler temperatures are consistent with substantial elevations. In turn, latitudinal gradients in temperature indicate that warming centered on polar regions played an important role during the Eocene \"hothouse\". Lastly, we show that the reconstructed Eocene relation between oxygen isotope ratios of precipitation and MAT is significantly different from the modem relation between these two variables. Because the relation has changed over time, the modern correlation should not be used to estimate paleo-MAT from measurements of oxygen isotope ratios in fossil material." ;

    schema:about "Identifying appropriate restoration goals has long posed a challenge in ecological restoration. The task becomes even more difficult in settings with diverse land use histories. After two decades of remediation, a former chemical weapons facility near Denver, Colorado, has become a national wildlife refuge. Restoration efforts have isolated contaminants and restored bison and native prairie, but the site's complex history invites a deeper consideration of reference conditions. This article presents data from a visitor survey and interviews with land managers and citizen groups to examine conceptions of historical fidelity at this site. Results indicate that visitors and land managers orient toward restoration that features a traditional reference condition. Citizen groups point to restoration of cultural features as the highest priorities. This research highlights disparities between constituencies and suggests that restoration work itself may shape values that inform visitors and affirm how a landscape ought to exist." ;

    schema:about "Both Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Baylor Johnson hold that under current circumstances, individuals lack obligations to reduce their personal contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. Johnson argues that climate change has the structure of a tragedy of the commons, and that there is no unilateral obligation to reduce emissions in a commons. Against Johnson, I articulate two rationales for an individual obligation to reduce one's greenhouse gas emissions. I first discuss moral integrity, which recommends congruence between one's actions and positions at the personal and political levels. Second, I draw on a Confucian, relational conception of persons to offer a critique of the collective action/tragedy of the commons framework itself. Under the relational conception, commons problems can be reconceptualised so as to dissolve the stark contrast between the individually and the collectively rational. This perspective can inform our approach to climate change and help reconcile individual and political action to mitigate it." ;

    schema:about "Can unilateral action be an effective response to global climate change? Baylor Johnson worries that a focus on unilateral action by individuals will detract from efforts to secure collective agreements to address the problem. Although Johnson and I agree that individuals have some obligation to reduce their personal emissions, we differ in the degree to which we see personal reductions as effective in spurring broader change. I argue that 'unilateral reductions' can have communicative value and that they can change the structure of collective action problems, making such problems easier to solve. Since collective action problems are much less tractable where individuals abide by the tenets of traditional game theory and much more tractable where individuals are oriented to cooperate and to trust that others will reciprocate, we need moral norms that promote individual restraint in exploitation of the commons, and we ought ourselves to abide by those norms." ;

Climate-change models predict a decrease in the range of sagebrush, but few studies have examined details of predicted changes oil sagebrush growth and the potential impacts of these changes oil the community. We analyzed effects of temperature, precipitation, and snow depth oil sagebrush annual ring width for 1969 to 2007 in the Gunnison Basin of Colorado. Temperature at all times of year except winter had negative correlations with ring widths; summer temperature had the strongest negative relationship. Ring widths correlated positively with precipitation in various seasons except summer; winter precipitation had the strongest relationship with growth. Maximum snow depth also cot-related positively and strongly with ring width. Multiple regressions, showed that summer temperature and either winter precipitation or maximum snow depth, which recharges deeper soil horizons, are both important in controlling growth. Overall, water stress and perhaps especially maximum snow depth appear to limit growth of this species. With predicted increases in temperature and probable reduced snow depth, sagebrush growth rates are likely to decrease. If so, sagebrush populations and cover may decline, which may have substantial effects on community composition and carbon balance." ;

    schema:about "Premise of the study: Darwin first proposed that species with larger ecological breadth have greater phenotypic variation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing intraspecific variation in specific leaf area (SLA) to species' local elevational range and by assessing how external (abiotic) filters may influence observed differences in ecological breadth among species. Understanding the patterns of individual variation within and between populations will help evaluate differing hypotheses for structuring of communities and distribution of species. Methods: We selected 21 species with varying elevational ranges and compared the coefficient of variation of SLA for each species against its local elevational range. We examined the influence of external filters on local trait composition by determining if intraspecific changes in SLA with elevation have the same direction and similar rates of change as the change in community mean SLA value. Key results: In support of Darwin's hypothesis, we found a positive relationship between species' coefficient of variation for SLA with species' local elevational range. Intraspecific changes in SLA had the same sign, but generally lower magnitude than the community mean SLA. Conclusions: The results indicate that wide-ranging species are indeed characterized by greater intraspecific variation and that species' phenotypes shift along environmental gradients in the same direction as the community phenotypes. However, across species, the rate of intraspecific trait change, reflecting plastic and/or adaptive changes across populations, is limited and prevents species from adjusting to environmental gradients as quickly as interspecific changes resulting from community assembly." ;

    schema:about "Maternal effects can have substantial impacts on plant fitness and plant populations. Stressful environmental conditions can cause a maternal plant to inadequately provision its progeny, resulting in poor seedling growth, low reproductive success, and decreased competitive ability. Maternal effects consist of environmental and genetic load components, but the interactions between these two components have rarely been considered. To determine the effects of maternal drought stress and maternal inbreeding on progeny biomass (a fitness correlate) and physiological responses to drought stress, we conducted a greenhouse experiment with genetic lines from two populations (mesic site vs. dry site) of the herbaceous annual Impatiens capensis (Balsaminaceae). Seeds were collected from cleistogamous flowers of inbred or outcrossed maternal plants that were subject to either a drought or control treatment. These seeds were grown into juvenile plants that were also subject to either a drought stress or a control treatment. Plants from the mesic site had significantly reduced biomass from maternal drought stress, while plants from the dry site maintained biomass despite adverse maternal environmental conditions. Juvenile plants of both populations had reduced biomass only as a result of maternal inbreeding. Interestingly, inbreeding depression was more apparent when maternal environmental conditions were benign." ;

    schema:about "Species diagnosis in Trogolaphysa has been based, until now, almost exclusively on number of eyes and shape of claws and mucro. Chaetotaxy, a character system important to diagnose species in other genera of scaled Entomobryoidea, has been described only for a few Trogolaphysa species. Here the complete dorsal chaetotaxy of six species of Trogolaphysa is described using the AMS and Szeptycki's systems for head and body, respectively. A morphology-based parsimony analysis was performed to evaluate whether chaetotaxic characters overcome the influence of putatively cave adaptive convergent characters to resolve species level relationships, and to evaluate the evolution of the dorsal macrochaetae of the head. Phylogenetic analysis using only putative cave-adaptive characters support clades of unrelated taxa, but the addition of chaetotaxy overcomes the influence of convergent characters. A phylogeny based on all characters supports a trend towards reduced head macrochaetae number. Head macrochaetae are lost beginning with A3 and followed, in order, by S5, S3 and M3. In addition, a checklist of New World Trogolaphysa is provided and two new species, Trogolaphysa giordanoae sp. n. and Trogolaphysa jacobyi sp. n., are described on the basis of material collected in six caves in southern Belize." ;

    schema:about "Bogidiellidae is the most diverse and cosmopolitan family of stygobiotic amphipods, and inhabits a variety of subterranean biotopes, especially interstitial habitats. While the family is characterized by considerable sexual dimorphism, this dimorphism has adversely affected our understanding of the systematics of the group. Most species have restricted geographic ranges and occur in difficult to sample habitats, so it is common for individual species descriptions to be based on a single sex. In this work we revisit an analysis of morphological characters in an attempt to clarify their phylogenetic utility in resolving taxonomic relationships among genera by introducing a new species, two additional characters, and phylogenetic statistical support values. Eobogidiella venkataramani sp. n., from a spring fed brook in the Shirawati River basin along the escarpment of the Western Ghats (Karnataka, India) differs from the only known congener, Eobogidiella purmamarcensis, from Argentina, in the structure of mouthparts, the shape and ornamentation on gnathopods and characters of the telson. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that the available morphological characters are not sufficient to resolve phylogenetic relationships within Bogidiellidae, thus these characters alone cannot be used to determine the phylogenetic placement of E. venkataramani sp. n. within the family. Nevertheless, E. venkataramani sp. n. shares diagnostic characters with Eobogidiella, supporting placement of the new species in this genus. Our findings point towards a critical need to resolve relationships within the family using molecular approaches, along with the development of a suite of additional morphological characters for Bogidiellidae. This is the third species of Bogidiellidae from southern India." ;

We find the credibility of the threat of relocation is essential to providing unbiased estimates of welfare. This study utilizes contingent valuation methodology (CVM) and a random utility model (RUM) to analyze Minnesotans' decision-making mechanisms for supporting a new stadium initiative. While previous studies have attempted to measure the welfare associated with a sports franchise, we develop and discuss bias that may be imparted to estimates when the researcher fails to calculate a \"choke price.\" Further, we develop an unbiased approach to identify welfare when respondents perceive a risk of losing the franchise. The range of welfare contribution by the Vikings to households in Minnesota is $445.3 million to $1,571.3 million according to a 95% confidence interval based on our study." ;

In total, forty-nine species of springtails were found. Four are described as new to science (Onychiurus pipistrellae n. sp., Pygmarrhopalites fransjanssens n. sp, P. incantator n. sp, and P. salemensis n. sp), four may represent new species but there is insufficient material available to prepare full descriptions (two species in the genus Superodontella, one in Pseudachorutes, one in Sminthurides), and three others (Ceratophysella cf. brevis, C. cf. lucifuga, and Folsomia cf. bisetosa) are identified to species, but differences from the nominal species suggest further studies may indicate the Illinois populations represent distinct forms. In addition, five other species represent new records for Illinois, and eighteen are new cave records for the species in North America. The new records more than double the number of springtails species known from caves in the Salem Plateau region. More than half (twenty-nine) of the species reported are ranked as rare (S1-S2) at the state level. The total number of springtail species in Salem Plateau caves could be more than twice what is recorded in the present study, and more new species and state records should be found when caves in other Illinois karst regions are more thoroughly examined.

    schema:about "Many environmental policies seem to rest on an implicit distinction between doing and allowing. For example, it is generally thought worse to drive a species to extinction than to fail to save a species that is declining through no fault of our own, and worse to pollute the air with chemicals that trigger asthma attacks than to fail to remove naturally occurring allergens such as pollen and mold. The distinction between doing and allowing seems to underlie certain versions of the precautionary principle, and insofar as the precautionary principle rests on this distinction, it diverges from direct consequentialist approaches to risk management. There are two ways in which such reliance on the doing/allowing distinction may be defended: by appeal to indirect consequentialist considerations, and by appeal to deontological considerations. Neither approach is unproblematic; however, retention of a distinction between doing and allowing in environmental policy is consistent with the widespread intuition that there is something prima facie valuable about the world as we find it." ;

    schema:about "One of the central worries raised in relation to ecological restoration concerns the problem of authenticity. Robert Elliot, for example, has argued that restoration \"fakes nature.\" On this view, restoration is like art forgery: it deceptively suggests that its product was produced in a certain way, when in fact, it was not. Restored landscapes present themselves as the product of \"natural processes,\" when in actuality, they have been significantly shaped by human intervention. For Elliott, there seem to be two sources of inauthenticity in ecological restoration: first, the restored landscape is inauthentic because its natural genealogy has been disrupted by the intervention of humans: it has lost its authentic natural identity; second, the restored landscape is inauthentic because it pretends to be something it is not: it obscures its own history. We argue that the first sense of authenticity is problematic; however, the second concern about obscuring history is important. Case studies involving the naturalization of former military lands can be used to tease out more fully the ways in which landscapes can be \"inauthentic\" by misleading observers about their genealogy. In such landscapes, it is not departure from \"the original\" per se that is the source of inauthenticity; rather, restored landscapes fail to be authentic when they deceptively obscure critical elements of their past." ;

    bf:Summary "\"Residential liberal arts colleges maintain a unique place in the landscape of American higher education. These schools are characterized by broad-based curricula, small class size, and interaction between students and faculty. Aimed at developing students' intellectual literacy and critical-thinking skills rather than specific professional preparation, the value proposition made by these colleges has recently come under intense pressure. Remaking College brings together a large and distinguished group of higher education leaders to define the American liberal arts model, to describe the challenges these institutions face, and to propose sustainable solutions.Both economic and strategic environments have developed to threaten these schools. Since 1990, for example, 35 percent of these institutions have transformed into \"professional\" colleges offering more vocational fields to their curricula while others have closed their doors entirely. Is there a future for these uniquely American institutions like Vassar and Smith, Macalester and Pomona, Middlebury and Swarthmore? Remaking College elucidates the shifting economic and financial models for liberal arts colleges and considers the opportunities afforded by technology, globalism, and intercollegiate cooperative models. Finally, it considers the unique position these schools can play in their communities and in the larger world\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "\"This Companion, the first dedicated to the philosopher and historian Xenophon of Athens, gives readers a sense of why he has held such a prominent place in literary and political culture from antiquity to the present and has been a favourite author of individuals as diverse as Machiavelli, Thomas Jefferson, and Leo Tolstoy. It also sets out the major problems and issues that are at stake in the study of his writings, while simultaneously pointing the way forward to newer methodologies, issues, and questions. Although Xenophon's historical, philosophical, and technical works are usually studied in isolation because they belong to different modern genres, the emphasis here is on themes that cut across his large and varied body of writings. This volume is accessible to students and general readers, including those previously unfamiliar with Xenophon, and will also be of interest to scholars in various fields\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;
