    schema:about "For m ? N, let Sm be the Suzuki curve defined over F22m+1. It is well-known that Sm is supersingular, but the p-torsion group scheme of its Jacobian is not known. The a-number is an invariant of the isomorphism class of the p-torsion group scheme. In this paper, we compute a closed formula for the a-number of Sm using the action of the Cartier operator on H0(Sm,O¹).

    schema:about "This article discusses a sample of 2,626 coins from an immense hoard of Athenian tetradrachms deposited 400 BC in northern Syria. A vast majority of the coins exhibit multiple types of surface markings. These markings include countermarks, cut countermark-like designs, graffiti, punch marks, cut edges and chisel cuts especially. Such markings are typical of smaller, contemporary hoards containing Athenian coinage found throughout the Near East. However, the large sample size offered by the present hoard further demonstrates that all of these different systems of surface markings conform to consistent patterns in placement and execution. There is nevertheless no similar consistency in the relationship between different marking systems appearing on the same coin. This suggests that each type of surface marking functioned independently but not exclusively as a regularized system of signification and circulation control within the Near East.]" ;

    schema:about "Although the universalising bent of Xenophonâ€™s leadership theory shows Socratic influence, its prioritisation of the general and the authorâ€™s fame for leading the Cyreans suggests an equal foundation in his battlefield experiences. In particular, the theoryâ€™s focus on securing willing obedience can be understood as a response to the novel fourth-century challenge of uniting ethnically disparate forces of free-agent mercenaries as an army, an issue central to Anabasis. Not only was Xenophon familiar with such a force, but he also shows an interest throughout his works in the advantages of mercenary professionalisation and specialisation, particularly with Jason of Pherae." ;

This paper describes the development and implementation of a method for assessing student learning outcomes in the MPA program at the University of Colorado Denver. The multi-method approach makes use of rubrics to examine whether students demonstrate the desired knowledge and skill, and student surveys to describe students' perceptions of their abilities in the same areas. Means for gaining faculty commitment to the process and making use of the information for program improvement are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher." ;

    schema:about "In the United States, men outnumber women in many science and engineering fields by nearly 3 to 1. In fields like physics or the geosciences, the gender gap can be even wider. Previous studies have identified the early college years as a critical point where many women exit STEM. An interdisciplinary team including expertise in the geosciences, psychology, education and STEM persistence have recently begun a 5-year project focused on understanding whether mentoring can increase the interest, persistence, and achievement of undergraduate women in the geosciences. The program focuses on mentoring first and second year female undergraduate students from four universities in Colorado and Wyoming and three universities in North and South Carolina. The mentoring program includes a weekend workshop, access to professional women across geoscience fields, and both in-person and virtual peer networks. The first weekend workshops were held in October 2015. The web-platform, designed to enable peer-mentoring and provide resources, was also launched in fall 2015: geosciencewomen.org. We will present an overview of the major components and lessons learned from the workshops. Using feedback from online surveys, we aim to 1) quantify the impact of the interventions (i.e. workshops and the professional and peer mentoring) on participants' intentions and behaviors related to geoscience career choices, 2) quantify the impact of the interventions on the skills and resources participants can use to overcome barriers for a career in the geosciences, and 3) quantify the key features of the interventions that predict positive changes in participants' perceptions of and beliefs about the geosciences. We will examine key processes that may explain why intervention elements have their effect on geoscience career choices. This project directly addresses diversity issues in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The activities aim to increase the number and diversity of women pursuing and completing an education in the geosciences. The project provides a program model and website for others to use, enhancing the potential for scalability." ;

    schema:about "When parents divorce, child support and visitation must be determined. The 1988 Family Support Act requires all states to have child support guidelines for courts to use in determining child support obligations. However, many divorcing couples arrive at agreements without court intervention, or they simply fail to enforce the court decision ex post. Given that the guidelines provide a starting point for negotiations, couples may be able to find self-negotiated, Pareto-improving solutions. In this paper we model the bargaining process that divorcing couples engage in when coming to agreements on visitation and child support. The model suggests that individuals may arrive at agreements that are Pareto improvements for both parents but that the children's welfare may decline as a result of these self-negotiated settlements. Data from the Stanford Child Custody Study show that the changes made in child support and visitation agreements are consistent with our model in only 30 percent of the cases. Therefore, we consider alternative specifications of the model and show that both significant costs of enforcing the original agreement and alternative assumptions on parental preferences can explain these empirical results." ;

    schema:about "This article examines politically motivated migration from El Salvador and Guatemala to the US. The author argues that the nature of these countries' insertion into the global economy require these states to devote considerable resources to establish relationships with their respective emigrant populations in the US. The Salvadoran immigrant hometown organizations have become incorporated into home country local development efforts at a higher level than their Guatemalan counterparts due to a more developed organizational structure, higher levels of interaction/collaboration with government officials, and a higher degree of democracy achieved in El Salvador as compared to Guatemala. Both Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrant organizations gain some leverage over the process of local development and politics in these countries. However, government policies that attempt to channel remittances will contribute little to productive development at the local level in the absence of state-supported macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in Guatemala and El Salvador.

    schema:about "We created two GIS labs (ArcGIS) that utilize the Learning for Use curricular design model (Edelson, 2001). Both labs are data-driven learning modules to motivate student learning and build new knowledge about climate and global change concepts. The first module utilizes satellite and model output data to engage students in predicting Earth's surface temperature without an atmosphere. Students then develop explanations as to the extent of radiative forcing providing by the atmosphere as a whole. These explanations are then compared with actual data; thus, allowing students to refine further their explanations. The second module uses a problem-based approach. Students are asked to use GIS to develop three scenarios, based on model data (Solomon, 2009 and Poore, et al., 2000) for global sea-level rise of 2.0, 17.0 and 90.0 meters. Students select their own geographic region to study, with many students choosing coastal communities with high population densities. Most students also chose to examine impacts on local hydrologic regimes. We present here preliminary data on student learning gains through implementation of knowledge surveys (Wirth, 2005)." ;

    schema:about "This paper evaluates the contribution of patent-related events to changes in stock prices, proposing that economics has traditionally failed to find much effect for two reasons which we identify and correct. First, patents vary widely in quality so we use quantile analysis and alternative measures of patent quality to identify effects. Second, we permit the possibility that information leaks out into investor sentiment during the long and uncertain time until patent grant, so evaluate the stock price effect at four different dates in the life of each patent. As a case study to test this approach, track all patents over a 27-year period for Apple Inc., permitting design patents to have different effects that traditional utility-model patents, and isolate the effect that Steve Jobs's name on a patent has at each stage of a patent's life." ;

    schema:about "Small firms are qualitatively different than large firms with respect to technology acquisition. As such, liberalization of technology flows in newly industrialized nations may have two potential effects, possibly felt differentially by small firms and large firms. First, technology flows may replace domestic research with cheaper imported foreign research. Second, they may combine with domestic research to improve local economic growth. This paper uses a unique firm-level dataset, modelling the choice between R&D expenditures and technology licensing behaviour in Brazil, explicitly considering corner solutions. Extending the results found elsewhere in the literature, econometric estimation of simultaneous input demand for capital, labor and both types of technology acquisition reveals that while very small firms see technology licensing and R&D as contemporaneous substitutes, firms of moderate to large size treat them as complements. Each firm's licensing experience also plays a key role in the decision." ;

While an extensive body of evidence demonstrates that patents and other intellectual property protections are critical to the future of innovation and the development of new treatments and cures, Canadian legislation fails to measure up. For example, Canada's intellectual property rights protections more closely mirror those of China, Turkey, Poland and the United Arab Emirates than industry leaders such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany.

Beyond such oral transmission, this song's presence is also maintained in North American culture through recordings.

From an early age, not only did Bernstein have a particular vision of how Rhapsody should operate; he also identified deeply with it. These findings provide important new insights into Bernstein's later, more polemical interpretations of the work in both recordings and the concert hall-interpretations that have had profound implications on the reception of Rhapsody on the global stage." ;

    schema:about "Considers the role that arrangements of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in blue, created and performed by Duke Ellington and his Ensemble, play in the construction of historical narratives about concert jazz. On their own, both the Rhapsody and Ellington appear to perform well-established roles: the Rhapsody remains the quintessential example of symphonic jazz in now-loaded definitions of the term and Ellington's output in this arena -- often referred to by jazz scholars as extended jazz composition -- forms a counter-narrative. Accordingly, a racialized barrier between the black, 'authentic' extended jazz compositions of Ellington and the white, 'inauthentic' symphonic jazz of Gershwin has emerged in critical and scholarly accounts of these traditions. However, when Ellington and the Rhapsody are considered in tandem, these barriers become more complex and permeable. Here, I consider three arrangements that survive in the Duke Ellington Collection at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The arrangements performed in 1925 and 1932 remove long-held assumptions that the Rhapsody was the provenience of white bands and provide insight into Ellington's own development of concertized jazz. The third version was recorded for Ellington's 1963 album Will big bands ever come back? Musical choices made within this latter arrangement align with then-present expectations of how the Ellington band of an earlier era should have sounded. Given Ellington's demonstrated interest in musical-historical narratives, I posit that specific decisions were made with respect to instrumentation and improvisation in an attempt to secure his place within the remapping of jazz history that occurred during the 1960s." ;

High-resolutionelectron micrographs and electron diffraction patterns collected fromcross sections of individual substrate-nanowire contacts in additionto scanning electron micrographs of the orientation of nanowires acrossentire films on substrates with different crystalline orientations,supported the notion of epitaxial nanowire growth. Energy dispersivespectroscopic elemental mapping of single nanowires indicated theGa(l) nanodroplet remains affixed to the tip of the growing nanowirethroughout the nanowire electrodeposition process. Current–voltageresponses measured across many individual nanowires yielded reproducibleresistance values. The presented data cumulatively show epitaxialgrowth of covalent group IV nanowires is possible from the reductionof a dissolved oxide under purely benchtop conditions.

    schema:about "CrystallineInAs films have been prepared directly at room temperaturethrough a new electrochemically induced alloying method by controllablyreducing As2O3dissolved in an alkaline aqueoussolution at an indium (In) foil electrode. Steady-state Raman spectra,transmission electron microscopy, and selected area electron diffractionindicated that the as-prepared films crystallize in the zincblendephase with no further thermal treatments. Cyclic voltammetry measurements,optical images, and steady-state Raman spectra confirmed that a cleanoxide-free interface is critical for the successful formation of thebinary InAs phase. The salient feature of this work is the use ofsimple aqueous electrochemistry to simultaneously remove passive metaloxides from the In(s) metal surface while controllably reducing dissolvedarsenic oxide at the interface to drive the In–As alloyingreaction. Raman spectral mapping data illustrate that the resultingfilm coverage and homogeneity are a strong function of the formalAs2O3concentration and the duration of theelectrodeposition experiment. Potential-dependent in situ Raman spectroscopywas used to implicate the solid-state reaction as the rate-limitingstep in InAs film formation over the first 160 min, after which solid-statediffusion dominated the kinetics. The collective results establisha precedent for an alternative synthetic strategy for crystallineInAs thin films that does not require vacuum or sophisticated furnaces,toxic gaseous precursors like arsine, or exotic solvents.

    schema:about "The substrate-overlayer approachhas been used to acquire surfaceenhanced Raman spectra (SERS) during and after electrochemical atomiclayer deposition (ECALD) of CdSe, CdTe, and CdS thin films. The collecteddata suggest that SERS measurements performed with off-resonance (i.e.far from the surface plasmonic wavelength of the underlying SERS substrate)laser excitation do not introduce perturbations to the ECALD processes.Spectra acquired in this way afford rapid insight on the quality ofthe semiconductor film during the course of an ECALD process. Forexample, SERS data are used to highlight ECALD conditions that yieldcrystalline CdSe and CdS films. In contrast, SERS measurements withshort wavelength laser excitation show evidence of photoelectrochemicaleffects that were not germane to the intended ECALD process. Usingthe semiconductor films prepared by ECALD, the substrate-overlayerSERS approach also affords analysis of semiconductor surface adsorbates.Specifically, Raman spectra of benzenethiol adsorbed onto CdSe, CdTe,and CdS films are detailed. Spectral shifts in the vibronic featuresof adsorbate bonding suggest subtle differences in substrate-adsorbateinteractions, highlighting the sensitivity of this methodology.

    schema:about "This Account describes a new electrochemicalsynthetic strategyfor direct growth of crystalline covalent group IV and III–Vsemiconductor materials at or near ambient temperature conditions.This strategy, which we call “electrochemical liquid–liquid–solid”(ec-LLS) crystal growth, marries the semiconductor solvation propertiesof liquid metal melts with the utility and simplicity of conventionalelectrodeposition. A low-temperature liquid metal (i.e., Hg, Ga, oralloy thereof) acts simultaneously as the source of electrons forthe heterogeneous reduction of oxidized semiconductor precursors dissolvedin an electrolyte as well as the solvent for dissolution of the zero-valentsemiconductor. Supersaturation of the semiconductor in the liquidmetal triggers eventual crystal nucleation and growth. In this way,the liquid electrolyte–liquid metal–solid crystal phaseboundary strongly influences crystal growth.

    bf:Summary "SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard's Concluding Unscientific Postscript has provoked a lively variety of divergent interpretations for a century and a half. It has been both celebrated and condemned as the chief inspiration for twentieth-century existential thought, as a subversive parody of philosophical argument, as a critique of mass society, as a forerunner of phenomenology and of postmodern relativism, and as an appeal for a renewal of religious commitment. These 2010 essays written by international Kierkegaard scholars offer a plurality of critical approaches to this fundamental text of existential philosophy. They cover hotly debated topics such as the tension between the Socratic-philosophical and the Christian-religious; the identity and personality of Kierkegaard's pseudonym 'Johannes Climacus'; his conceptions of paradoxical faith and of passionate understanding; his relation to his contemporaries and to some of his more distant predecessors; and, last but not least, his pertinence to our present-day concerns."@en ;

    schema:about "Scenario analysis is a useful tool for exploring key uncertainties that may shape the future of social-ecological systems. This paper explores the methods, costs, and benefits of developing and linking scenarios of social-ecological systems across multiple spatial scales. Drawing largely on experiences in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we suggest that the desired degree of cross-scale linkage depends on the primary aim of the scenario exercise. Loosely linked multiscale scenarios appear more appropriate when the primary aim is to engage in exploratory dialog with stakeholders. Tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios seem to work best when the main objective is to further our understanding of cross-scale interactions or to assess trade-offs between scales. The main disadvantages of tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios are that their development requires substantial time and financial resources, and that they often suffer loss of credibility at one or more scales. The reasons for developing multiscale scenarios and the expectations associated with doing so therefore need to be carefully evaluated when choosing the desired degree of cross-scale linkage in a particular scenario exercise." ;

    schema:about "For at least the past 8000 years, small-scale farmers in semi-arid environments have had to mitigate shortfalls in crop production due to variation in precipitation and stream flow. To reduce their vulnerability to a shortfall in their food supply, small-scale farmers developed short-term strategies, including storage and community-scale sharing, to mitigate inter-annual variation in crop production, and long-term strategies, such as migration, to mitigate the effects of sustained droughts. We use the archaeological and paleoclimatic records from A.D. 900-1600 in two regions of the American Southwest to explore the nature of variation in the availability of water for crops, and the strategies that enhanced the resilience of prehistoric agricultural production to climatic variation. Drawing on information concerning contemporary small-scale farming in semi-arid environments, we then suggest that the risk coping and mitigation strategies that have endured for millennia are relevant to enhancing the resilience of contemporary farmers' livelihoods to environmental and economic perturbations." ;

    schema:about "The May 12th, 2008 Sichuan earthquake was a national trauma in China. The reconstruction provided the Party with an opportunity to display its care for the disaster victims and restore the Party's shaken credibility and socialist legitimacy. Despite initial collective solidarity and firm control over the state apparatus, levers of the economy, and domestic media, the Party did not manage to secure broad public approval of its reconstruction effort in the earthquake zone. This article argues that the reasons for this failure can be traced to the Party's political epistemology. The CCP's general assumptions, governmental rationalities, policy calculations, implementation strategies, and legitimating discourses organized the reconstruction. It wanted to build a model of state power and benevolence, but it did not have the proper tools. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

    schema:about "This essay is an attempt to add to the argument that beauty matters in education through offering a reciprocal but interconnected point: if the dynamic harmony and deep connectedness of beauty need to be taken seriously, so must their aesthetic converse--the disharmony and estrangement of failure. While the discourse of philosophical aesthetics has long included categories such as the beautiful, the good, and the virtuous, the seeds for achievement of these ideals are planted in the soil of disharmony, uncertainty, and failure. Using a Deweyan account of art as experience, this essay argues that disharmony and failure are as much aesthetic categories as harmony and beauty and must be taken as seriously in teaching and learning. It further argues that failure, rather than beauty, is often more suited to providing the foundation for unlocking the unique potential of students and helping them cultivate their capacity for creative thought and action.

The philosophers are similar in thoughts covering the study and practice of politics, the role of natural law in law and policy creation, and the idea of academic education on politics. The influence of philosophers Aristotle and Augustine on the philosophies of Mill and Oakeshott is discussed." ;

    schema:about "The Tutt Library at Colorado College is developing a portfolio of library applications for use by patrons and library staff. Developed under an iterative and incremental agile model, these single-use HTML5 applications target multiple devices while using Bootstrap and Django to deliver fast and responsive interfaces to underlying FRBR datastores running on Redis, an advanced NoSQL database server. Two types are delineated: applications for access and discovery, which are available to everyone; and productivity applications, which are primarily for library staff to administer and manage the FRBR-RDA records. The access portfolio includes Book Search, Article Search, Call Number, and Library Hours applications. The productivity side includes an Orders App and a MARC Batch application for ingesting MARC records as FRBR entities using RDA Core attributes. When a critical threshold is reached, the Tutt Library intends to replace its legacy ILS with this library application portfolio." ;

Consequently, certain conditions of affluence may actually contribute to the proliferation of certain diseases like the virulent coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thus certain pathogens colonize ecological niches within affluent and technologically sophisticated societies. These so-called plagues of affluence represent a challenge to global health that is largely unaddressed." ;

    schema:about "In both psychology and philosophy, cognitive theories of emotion have met with increasing opposition in recent years. However, this apparent controversy is not so much a gridlock between antithetical stances as a critical debate in which each side is being forced to qualify its position in order to accommodate the other side of the story. Here, I attempt to sort out some of the disagreements between cognitivism and its rivals, adjudicating some disputes while showing that others are merely superficial. Looking at evidence from neuroscience and social psychology, as well as thought experiments and theoretical arguments, I conclude that it is necessary to acknowledge both that emotions have intentional content and that they involve somatic agitation. I also point out some of the more promising directions for future research in this area." ;

    schema:about "There are two interrelated acyl-homoserine lactone quorum-sensing-signaling systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These systems, the LasR-LasI system and the RhiR. RhlI system, are global regulators of gene expression. We performed a transcriptome analysis to identify quorum-sensing-controlled genes and to better understand quorum-sensing control of P. aeruginosa gene expression. We compared gene expression in a LasI-RhlI signal mutant grown with added signals to gene expression without added signals, and we compared a LasR-RhlR signal receptor mutant to its parent. In all, we identified 315 quorum-induced and 38 quorumrepressed genes, representing about 6% of the P. aeruginosa genome. The quorum-repressed genes were activated in the stationary phase in quorum-sensing mutants but were not activated in the parent strain. The analysis of quorum-induced genes suggests that the signal specificities are on a continuum and that the timing of gene expression is on a continuum (some genes are induced early in growth, most genes are induced at the transition from the logarithmic phase to the stationary phase, and some genes are induced during the stationary phase). In general, timing was not related to signal concentration. We suggest that the level of the signal receptor, LasR, is a critical trigger for quorum-activated gene expression. Acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing appears to be a system that allows ordered expression of hundreds of genes during P. aeruginosa growth in culture.

The curriculum begins with organisms, and introductory students have to complete two of four courses: Biology of Microbes, Biology of Plants, Biology of Invertebrates and Biology of Vertebrates. Most of these courses involve students working in teams on a project in which they learn through authentic inquiry. The college encourages all students to pursue independent research activities with the faculty." ;

    schema:about "By focusing on the Garfish Dance song, which is performed by several Woodland communities, the role of music in maintaining a state of dynamic equilibrium between tribalism and intertribalism among Woodland peoples in Oklahoma is explored. While music and dance serve as powerful symbols of local identity in Woodland communities, these cultural forms thrive not in bounded groups but at the social intersections of larger regional systems. Music provides one route to understanding and appreciating this more complex social world." ;

    schema:about "This article describes a study assessing the impact of reference services on undergraduate students. The study targeted undergraduates receiving nondirectional reference assistance, yielding sixty-nine survey responses and five follow-up interviews. Three outcomes were examined: (1) Do undergraduate students perceive the reference staff as being friendly and approachable? (2) Do they learn something during the course of the reference interaction? and (3) Do they feel more confident about their ability to find information after the reference interaction than they did before? Our findings suggest that reference services can play a significant role in helping students become confident, independent information seekers. Correlations between variables and a multiple regression model further indicate that friendliness of the reference staff was one of the best predictors of students' confidence in their ability to find information on their own. These outcomes are particularly salient in a college and university environment where building skills for independent information exploration is a primary goal.

    schema:about "Abstract Section 112(m) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, referred to as the Great Waters Program, mandated an assessment of atmospheric deposition of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) to Lake Champlain. Mercury (Hg) was listed as a priority HAP and has continued to be a high priority for a number of national and international programs. An assessment of the magnitude and seasonal variation of atmospheric Hg levels and deposition in the Lake Champlain basin was initiated in December 1992 which included event precipitation collection, as well as collection of vapor and particle phase Hg in ambient air. Sampling was performed at the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill Center, VT. The range in the annual volume-weighted mean concentration for Hg in precipitation was 7.8–10.5 ng/l for the 11-year sampling period and the average amount of Hg deposited with each precipitation event was 0.10 µg/m2. The average amount of Hg deposited through precipitation each year from 1993 to 2003 was 9.7 µg/m2/yr. A seasonal pattern for Hg in precipitation is clearly evident, with increased Hg concentrations and deposition observed during spring and summer months. While a clear trend in the 11-year event deposition record at Underhill was not observed, a significant decrease in the event max-to-monthly ratio was observed suggesting that a major source influence was controlled over time. Discrete precipitation events were responsible for significant fractions of the monthly and annual loading of Hg to the forested ecosystem in Vermont. Monthly-averaged temperatures were found to be moderately correlated with monthly volume-weighted mean Hg concentrations (r2=0.61) and Hg deposition (r2=0.67) recorded at the Vermont site. Meteorological analysis indicated the highest levels of Hg in precipitation were associated with regional transport from the west, southwest, and south during the warmer months.

    schema:about "Thoreau's journal contains a number of passages which explore the nature of perception, developing a response to skeptical doubt. The world outside the human mind is real, and there is nothing illusory about its perceived beauty and meaning. In this essay, I draw upon the work of Stanley Cavell (among others) in order to frame Thoreau's reflections within the context of the skeptical questions he seeks to address. Value is not a subjective projection, but it also cannot be perceived without the appropriate kind of emotional orientation or attunement toward the world: that is, an attitude of trust or acceptance. Without this affective receptivity, or \"perceptual faith,\" our knowledge of reality is limited. The beliefs we hold onto in the face of objective uncertainty establish the framework within which we make particular evaluations, and in this sense they are a necessary condition of practical reason. Every understanding has its mood." ;

    schema:about "Gmelch's (1974) claim that professional athletes were more superstitious during difficult tasks than easy tasks was tested in a golf putting experiment. Forty college students, 26 male and 14 female, of varying golfing abilities, were tested in 20 easy putts from 3 feet, and 20 difficult putts from 9 feet. Using four colored balls, superstitious behavior was defined as selecting the same colored ball after a made putt, consistent with the methodology of Van Raalte, Brewer, Nemeroff, and Under (1991). Skill level was assessed by a median split of total putts made. There was a significant interaction between level of putt difficulty and skill level on superstitious behavior. Low skill participants were more superstitious in the easy putting task than the difficult putting task, and high skill participants were more superstitious in the difficult putting task than the easy putting task. Gmelch's claims were supported by the high skill participants' behavior and may be explained by the uncertainty hypothesis. The low skill participants' behavior did not support Gmelch's claims, and may be better explained by the reciprocal nature of learned helplessness and superstitious behavior.

    schema:about "Two student groups, introductory psychology (n = 91) and advanced neuroscience (n = 34) undergraduates, were asked to malinger a head injury on Rey's 15-Item Test (FIT) and Dot Counting Test (DCT). The participants were randomly assigned to one of three motivation conditions (no motivation given, compensation, avoidance of blame for a motor vehicle accident) and to one of three coaching conditions (no coaching, coaching post-concussive symptoms, coaching symptoms plus warning of malingering detection). Analyses revealed a Motivation x Student Group interaction on the FIT, indicating that the advanced neuroscience students, particularly when in the compensation condition, malingered the most flagrantly. On the DCT, main effects for motivation and coaching on the qualitative variables and a Motivation x Coaching interaction on the accuracy variables indicated that those in the compensation condition performed the most poorly, and that coaching plus warning only tempers malingering on memory tasks, not timed tasks.

Deep curriculum is framed around contemporary issues in education including the epidemic of teacher attrition. We offer concrete examples from a qualitative study and a pilot program of deep curriculum conducted in a teacher education program.

    schema:about "In professional sports teams that win games consistently do well financially. Over the years, profits have motivated professional sports teams to search for good players. In their pursuit of wins, teams have recruited talented players regardless of their race or national origin. This paper examines the effects of hiring a diverse set of players on team success in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The effects of employee heterogeneity on team performance are tested using panel data from the 2002-2008 NBA seasons. This paper shows the benefits and problems associated with employing a geographically diverse workforce in the NBA. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a measure of market power, is adapted to measure team diversity. Win percentages of teams are regressed against their HHIs and other control variables such as player talent and coaching expertise. The results show that increases in diversity as measured by the HHI and international player's minutes lead to higher win percentages for their teams.

    schema:about "Xenophon's programmatic preface to his narrative of the revolution at Thebes (Hellenica 5.4.1) in 378 B.C.E. suggests that the author positions the stasis there as an interpretive model for the larger contemporary wars over mainland hegemony, similar to Thucydides with Corcyra. Accordingly, the abuses of the Spartan-backed government at Thebes and the resentment that these provoke provide a blueprint for understanding the broader disintegration of support for Sparta's hegemony in the period before Leuctra. However, Sparta's contrastingly fair resolution of a stasis at Phlius and the enduring loyalty that this engenders further provided Xenophon with the opportunity to introduce an alternative paradigm of benevolent hegemony.

It is vital to examine parks and conservation critically to identify places where they are exacerbating resource struggles that often result from globalization and development, in the United States and in other countries. This article uses Foucauldian discourse analysis to identify conflicting discourses present in this conflict and to analyze knowledge and power in relation to issues of resource and land use in protected areas. This analysis highlights differences in scale and logic between the discourse used by local stakeholders, and the discourse used by conservation organizations and Park officials, in the Point Reyes conflict and in other National Parks" ;

    schema:about "The Goodeniaceae, close relatives of the Asteraceae, are a conspicuous part of the flora of Australia and many islands in the Pacific. A comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family using cpDNA regions trnL-F and matK is presented, including representatives of all genera and nearly half the species. The family resolves into the two large clades: 'LAD' (Lechenaultia, Anthotium, Dampiera) and 'Core Goodeniaceae' (Brunonia, Scaevola, Diaspasis, Coopernookia, Goodenia, Selliera, Velleia, Verreauxia, Pentaptilon), which are also supported by morphological characters. The former Brunoniaceae, comprising the single species Brunonia australis, is clearly placed within the Goodeniaceae as sister to the remainder of Core Goodeniaceae while possessing many autapomorphic characteristics. Current subgeneric taxonomic groups are partially supported as monophyletic within Goodenia and Dampiera, but are generally non-monophyletic within Lechenaultia and Scaevola. Fruit types and floral traits involved in pollination and adaptations to aridity have evolved in a highly convergent fashion within several major clades. Rates of molecular evolution and number of extant taxa differ at several points between sister clades, particularly between Brunonia and the rest of Core Goodeniaceae, and between Scaevoia s.l. and Goodenia s.l. Future taxonomic changes will involve the synonymization of Selliera and monotypic Diasposis and, pending more comprehensive taxon and molecular sampling, the large, paraphyletic genus Goodenia may be split into at least three genera." ;

Participants in a mixed-method study responded to an anonymized chat transcript. While student respondents valued speed and efficiency, they were willing to receive instruction and open to questions that demonstrated interest or moved the research forward. Librarian and instructor comments focused on how these chats supported or could better support student learning, as well as on the interplay between classroom teaching, library instruction, and reference. The authors also identify implications that these findings have for the development of best practices in chat reference.

    schema:about "The recent stagnation of electronic commerce highlights the need to understand contemporary online consumer behavior. E-commerce's slow growth has coincided with an explosion in the usage of Web 2.0 activities. These novel online venues have created many new channels for online retailers to reach buyers, yet these online activities have gone largely unstudied. This study incorporates current user demographics and Web 2.0 activities to dynamically model the determinants of two key measurements of recent online shopping, a recent purchase and the novel dependent variable, percentage of income spent online. Regression analysis is applied to a nationally representative 2007 survey of the U.S. online population. Determinants of a recent online purchase include, ownership of a credit card, PayPalTM account, listening to podcasts, participating in online auctions, and for the first time, female gender. In a second regression, positive determinants for the percentage of income spent online include male gender, educational attainment, online auctions, instant messaging, and online dating. Online spending increases with time online, and appears to compete with other forms of online entertainment and social networking. These results produce snapshots of contemporary online shoppers that can be used by electronic retailers to determine which product characteristics to highlight for greatest impact, and to efficiently target specific Web 2.0 activities, such as entertainment, podcast and social network websites, to develop new and robust marketing platforms." ;

    schema:about "Here we report the results of fine resolution Y chromosomal analyses (Y-SNP and Y-STR) of 267 Bantu-speaking males from three populations located in the southeast region of Africa. In an effort to determine the relative Y chromosomal affinities of these three genotyped populations, the findings are interpreted in the context of 74 geographically and ethnically targeted African reference populations representing four major ethno-linguistic groups (Afro-Asiatic, Niger Kordofanin, Khoisan and Pygmoid). In this investigation, we detected a general similarity in the Y chromosome lineages among the geographically dispersed Bantu-speaking populations suggesting a shared heritage and the shallow time depth of the Bantu Expansion. Also, micro-variations in the Bantu Y chromosomal composition across the continent highlight location-specific gene flow patterns with non-Bantu-speaking populations (Khoisan, Pygmy, Afro-Asiatic). Our Y chromosomal results also indicate that the three Bantu-speaking Southeast populations genotyped exhibit unique gene flow patterns involving Eurasian populations but fail to reveal a prevailing genetic affinity to East or Central African Bantu-speaking groups. In addition, the Y-SNP data underscores a longitudinal partitioning in sub-Sahara Africa of two R1b1 subgroups, R1b1-P25* (west) and R1b1a2-M269 (east). No evidence was observed linking the B2a haplogroup detected in the genotyped Southeast African Bantu-speaking populations to gene flow from contemporary Khoisan groups." ;

    schema:about "P-type macroporous gallium phosphide (GaP) photoelectrodes have been prepared by anodic etching of an undoped, intrinsically n-type GaP(100) wafer and followed by drive-in doping with Zn from conformal ZnO films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Specifically, 30 nm ALD ZnO films were coated on GaP macroporous films and then annealed at T = 650 ©‚?'C for various times to diffuse Zn in GaP. Under 100 mW cm©Ø?€?“©‚?ø white light illumination, the resulting Zn-doped macroporous GaP consistently exhibit strong cathodic photocurrent when measured in aqueous electrolyte containing methyl viologen. Wavelength-dependent photoresponse measurements of the Zn-doped macroporous GaP revealed enhanced collection efficiency at wavelengths longer than 460 nm, indicating that the ALD doping step rendered the entire material p-type and imparted the ability to sustain a strong internal electric field that preferentially drove photogenerated electrons to the GaP/electrolyte interface. Collectively, this work presents a doping strategy with a potentially high degree of controllability for high-aspect ratio III©Ø?€?“V materials, where the ZnO ALD film is a practical dopant source for Zn." ;

    schema:about "An electrochemical liquid©Ø?€?“liquid©Ø?€?“solid (ec-LLS) process that yields crystalline silicon at low temperature (80 ©‚?'C) without any physical or chemical templating agent has been demonstrated. Electroreduction of dissolved SiCl©Ø?‚?„ in propylene carbonate using a liquid gallium Ga(l)] pool as the working electrode consistently yielded crystalline Si. X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction data separately indicated that the as-deposited materials were crystalline with the expected patterns for a diamond cubic crystal structure. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies further revealed the as-deposited materials (i.e., with no annealing) to be faceted nanocrystals with diameters in excess of 500 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra further showed no evidence of any other species within the electrodeposited crystalline Si. Raman spectra separately showed that the electrodeposited films on the Ga(l) electrodes were not composed of amorphous carbon from solvent decomposition. The cumulative data support two primary contentions. First, a liquid-metal electrode can serve simultaneously as both a source of electrons for the heterogeneous reduction of dissolved Si precursor in the electrolyte (i.e., a conventional electrode) and a separate phase (i.e., a solvent) that promotes Si crystal growth. Second, ec-LLS is a process that can be exploited for direct production of crystalline Si at much lower temperatures than ever reported previously. The further prospect of ec-LLS as an electrochemical and non-energy-intensive route for preparing crystalline Si is discussed." ;

    schema:about "The substrate-overlayer approach has been used to acquire surface enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) during and after electrochemical atomic layer deposition (ECALD) of CdSe, CdTe, and CdS thin films. The collected data suggest that SERS measurements performed with off-resonance (i.e. far from the surface plasmonic wavelength of the underlying SERS substrate) laser excitation do not introduce perturbations to the ECALD processes. Spectra acquired in this way afford rapid insight on the quality of the semiconductor film during the course of an ECALD process. For example, SERS data are used to highlight ECALD conditions that yield crystalline CdSe and CdS films. In contrast, SERS measurements with short wavelength laser excitation show evidence of photoelectrochemical effects that were not germane to the intended ECALD process. Using the semiconductor films prepared by ECALD, the substrate-overlayer SERS approach also affords analysis of semiconductor surface adsorbates. Specifically, Raman spectra of benzenethiol adsorbed onto CdSe, CdTe, and CdS films are detailed. Spectral shifts in the vibronic features of adsorbate bonding suggest subtle differences in substrate-adsorbate interactions, highlighting the sensitivity of this methodology." ;

    schema:about "Carbon market projects have focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, often at the expense of achieving sustainable development goals. A central pillar in sustainable development is equity, yet most projects pay little attention to equity implications for underrepresented farmers, especially women. Agricultural carbon market projects that explicitly seek to promote sustainable agricultural land management practices are quickly gaining attention worldwide for their promise to deliver the 'triple-win': adaptation, food security, and mitigation. Previous experience with other payment for ecosystem services projects indicate that women often are marginalized and their needs ignored. To address this gap, this case study examined the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project with a focus on gender equity in access, decision making, and outcomes. Results show that women had less access to joining the project than men, because they did not have the same level of influence in decision making at a household level. At the project level, both men and women had little influence in establishing project requirements and potential benefits, as these were decided upon prior to farmer recruitment. Regarding outcomes, women tended to participate in more project activities, and would in return reap more nonmonetary benefits than men. However, the costs involved in achieving these benefits was nontrivial: women's farm labor time increased significantly due to the substantial time and effort required to implement sustainable agricultural land management practices. If agricultural soil carbon market projects are to achieve better outcomes by addressing equity issues, they need to pay special attention to gender and the differing needs of farmers--male, female, young, old, poor, and less poor--by involving them at the project design stage. Our findings show the importance of additional project benefits unrelated to carbon income for addressing the requirements of equity perceived by both the implementing agency and women themselves." ;

    schema:about "We investigated lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of 22 male and 46 female adult Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) in Colorado from 1981-2003. Sexual differences in LRS were at least partially attributable to incomplete breeding histories of females, due to females having a higher estimated emigration rate from the study area than males. The mean number of lifetime breeding attempts for males was 3.4 ?l 0.6 (SE; range = 1-12), and for females it was 1.9 ?l 0.3 (range = 1-8). Adjusted for emigration beyond the study area, the estimated mean number of lifetime breeding attempts was 3.6 for males and 2.5 for females. The mean number of lifetime successful breeding attempts (fledging at least one owlet) was similar to lifetime breeding attempts for each sex, reflecting the fact that 84% (85 of 101) of all breeding attempts were successful. Breeding lifespan was correlated with lifetime reproduction for both sexes. Males tended nests that produced 6.9 ?l 1.2 fledglings over 4.3 ?l 0.8 yr, while females produced 4.0 ?l 0.6 fledglings over 2.0 ?l 0.3 yr; adjusted for emigration beyond the study area, males tended nests that produced 7.2 fledglings over 4.5 yr, while females produced 5.2 fledglings over 2.6 yr. Relatively few individuals of each sex produced most of the offspring, as 18% of females and 24% of males produced 50% of total owlets. Our finding that relatively few adults accounted for most offspring appears to be associated with habitat quality in territories. Flammulated Owls tend to have a life-history strategy similar to larger raptors by having a relatively low annual reproductive rate and a relatively long lifespan." ;

    schema:about "Rising pharmaceutical prices, increasing demand for more effective innovative drugs and growing public outrage have heightened criticism of the pharmaceutical industry. The public debate has focused on drug prices and access. As a consequence, the patent system is being reexamined as an efficient mechanism for encouraging pharmaceutical innovation and drug development. We propose an alternative to the existing patent system, instead rewarding the innovating firm with direct tax credits in exchange for marginal cost pricing. This concept is based on the fundamental assumption that innovation that benefits society at large may be financed publicly. As an industry which produces a social good characterized by high fixed costs, high information and regulatory costs, and relatively low marginal costs of production, pharmaceuticals are well-suited to such a mechanism. Under this proposal, drug prices fall, consumer surplus increases, access is enhanced, and the incentives to innovate are preserved." ;

    schema:about "In this paper, we employ three simple theoretical models of nonprofit hospitals to investigate equilibrium behavior when hospitals compete. Utilizing a differentiated Bertrand model, we examine how prices, quantity of patients served, service to the uninsured, and quality of care are affected as nonprofits place more weight on profit maximization. We find that the specification of the nonprofit motive greatly impacts the results. When the nonprofit motive is maximizing output, prices rise for both hospitals as the nonprofit moves away from its nonprofit motive. However, if the nonprofit cares about serving the uninsured, prices in the market fall. Finally, when hospitals compete on price and quality, more emphasis on profits results in an increase in price at the for-profit hospital and a decrease in price at the nonprofit hospital. These results suggest that the importance of the nonprofit motive has been underestimated and should be further investigated." ;

The case considers the potential for a dual monopoly (by the Red Cross in both markets), limit pricing on the part of the Red Cross in the market for red blood cells, and a shared market in which the Red Cross is a monopoly in the market for plasma but competes with the Blood Centers of America in the market for red blood cells." ;

    schema:about "To identify which spouses respond to asymmetric information, I play two dictator games with each member of the couple. One decision is kept secret from the respondent's spouse, while another choice is public. Most people give the same amount in public and secret, while a minority behave opportunistically and give more to their spouse in public and less in secret. The types identified in the lab also behave differently at home. For those who behave opportunistically in the lab, greater knowledge about finances at home is associated with worse opportunism in the lab, suggesting that for these couples complete information at home is not due to trust but rather is an endogenous response to non-cooperative behavior. The paper highlights that allowing for heterogeneous types changes the conclusions we draw about appropriate models of the household and suggests that laboratory games can be used to identify household types useful in the interpretation of field data." ;

We use trace gas measurements, air mass back trajectories, and a chemical box model to confirm the origin and chemical history of the sampled air mass. We find the presence of elevated oxidized mercury to be consistent with oxidation of elemental mercury by bromine atoms in this subsiding upper tropospheric air mass within the subtropical Pacific High, where dry atmospheric conditions are conducive to oxidized mercury accumulation. Our results support the role of bromine as the dominant oxidant of mercury in the upper troposphere." ;

    schema:about "The crustal structure of north-central Wyoming records a history of complex lithospheric evolution from Precambrian accretion to Cretaceous-Paleogene Laramide shortening. We present two active source P wave velocity model profiles collected as part of the Bighorn Arch Seismic Experiment in 2010. Analyses of these velocity models and single-fold reflection data, together with potential field modeling of regional gravity and magnetic signals, constrain crustal structure and thickness of the Bighorn region. We image a west dipping reflection boundary and model a sharp magnetic contact east of the Bighorn Arch that together may delineate a previously undetected Precambrian suture zone. Localized patches of a high-velocity, high-density lower crustal layer (the 7.x layer) occur across the study area but are largely absent beneath the Bighorn Arch culmination. Moho topography is relatively smooth with no large-scale offsets, with depths ranging from similar to 50 to 37km, and is largely decoupled from Laramide basement topography. These observations suggest that (1) the edge of the Archean Wyoming craton lies just east of the Bighorn Mountains, approximately 300km west of previous interpretations, and (2) Laramide deformation localized in an area with thin or absent 7.x layer, due to its relatively weak lower crust, leading to detachment faulting. Our findings show that Precambrian tectonics in northern Wyoming may be more complicated than previously determined and subsequent Laramide deformation may have been critically dependent on laterally heterogeneous crustal structure that can be linked to Precambrian origins." ;

    schema:about "Knowledge of the local state of stress is critical in appraising intraplate seismic hazard. Inverting earthquake moment tensors, we demonstrate that principal stress directions in the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) differ significantly from those in the surrounding region. Faults in the NMSZ that are incompatible with slip in the regional stress field are favorably oriented relative to local stress. We jointly analyze seismic velocity, gravity, and topography to develop a 3-D crustal and upper mantle density model, revealing uniquely dense lower crust beneath the NMSZ. Finite element simulations then estimate the stress tensor due to gravitational body forces, which sums with regional stress. The anomalous lower crust both elevates gravity-derived stress at seismogenic depths in the NMSZ and rotates it to interfere more constructively with far-field stress, producing a regionally maximal deviatoric stress coincident with the highest concentration of modern seismicity. Moreover, predicted principal stress directions mirror variations (observed independently in moment tensors) at the NMSZ and across the region. Abstract Copyright (2016), .

    schema:about "In coastal rivers, tidal pumping enhances the exchange of oxygen-rich river water across the sediment-water interface, controlling nitrogen cycling in riverbed sediment. We developed a one-dimensional, fluid flow and solute transport model that quantifies the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal and applied it to the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ) of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA). In field observations and models, both oxygenated river water and anoxic groundwater deliver nitrate to carbon-rich riverbed sediment. A zone of nitrate removal forms beneath the aerobic interval, which expands and contracts over daily timescales due to tidal pumping. At high tide when oxygen-rich river water infiltrates into the bed, denitrification rates decrease by 25% relative to low tide. In the absence of tidal pumping, our model predicts that the aerobic zone would be thinner, and denitrification rates would increase by 10%. As tidal amplitude increases toward the coast, nitrate removal rates should decrease due to enhanced oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface, based on sensitivity analysis. Denitrification hot spots in TFZs are more likely to occur in less permeable sediment under lower tidal ranges and higher rates of ambient groundwater discharge. Our models suggest that tidal pumping is not efficient at removing surface water nitrate but can remove up to 81% of nitrate from discharging groundwater in the TFZ of White Clay Creek. Given the high population densities of coastal watersheds, the reactive riverbeds of TFZs play a critical role in mitigating new nitrogen loads to coasts.

    schema:about "A tear in the subducting Nazca slab is located between the end of the Pampean flat slab and normally subducting oceanic lithosphere. Tomographic studies suggest mantle material flows through this opening. The best way to probe this hypothesis is through observations of seismic anisotropy, such as shear wave splitting. We examine patterns of shear wave splitting using data from two seismic deployments in Argentina that lay updip of the slab tear. We observe a simple pattern of plate-motion-parallel fast splitting directions, indicative of plate-motion-parallel mantle flow, beneath the majority of the stations. Our observed splitting contrasts previous observations to the north and south of the flat slab region. Since plate-motion-parallel splitting occurs only coincidentally with the slab tear, we propose mantle material flows through the opening resulting in Nazca plate-motion-parallel flow in both the subslab mantle and mantle wedge." ;

    schema:about "Objectives: Von Economo neurons (VENs) are defined by their thin, elongated cell body and long dendrites projecting from apical and basal ends. These distinctive neurons are mostly present in anterior cingulate (ACC) and fronto-insular (FI) cortex, with particularly high densities in cetaceans, elephants, and hominoid primates (i.e., humans and apes). This distribution suggests that VENs contribute to specializations of neural circuits in species that share both large brain size and complex social cognition, possibly representing an adaptation to rapidly relay socially-relevant information over long distances across the brain. Recent evidence indicates that unique patterns of protein expression may also characterize VENs, particularly involving molecules that are known to regulate gut and immune function. Methods: In this study, we used quantitative stereologic methods to examine the expression of three such proteins that are localized in VENs-activating-transcription factor 3 (ATF3), interleukin 4 receptor (IL4R alpha), and neuromedin B (NMB). We quantified immunoreactivity against these proteins in different morphological classes of ACC layer V neurons of hominoids. Results: Among the different neuron types analyzed (pyramidal, VEN, fork, enveloping, and other multipolar), VENs showed the greatest percentage that displayed immunostaining. Additionally, a higher proportion of VENs in humans were immunoreactive to ATF3, IL4Ra, and NMB than in other apes. No other ACC layer V neuron type displayed a significant species difference in the percentage of immunoreactive neurons. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that phylogenetic variation exists in the protein expression profile of VENs, suggesting that humans might have evolved biochemical specializations for enhanced interoceptive sensitivity.

    schema:about "The structure of the hippopotamus brain is virtually unknown because few studies have examined more than its external morphology. In view of their semiaquatic lifestyle and phylogenetic relatedness to cetaceans, the brain of hippopotamuses represents a unique opportunity for better understanding the selective pressures that have shaped the organization of the brain during the evolutionary process of adaptation to an aquatic environment. Here we examined the histology of the cerebral cortex of the pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) by means of Nissl, Golgi, and calretinin (CR) immunostaining, and provide a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural and volumetric dataset of the anatomy of its brain. We calculated the corpus callosum area/brain mass ratio (CCA/BM), the gyrencephalic index (GI), the cerebellar quotient (CQ), and the cerebellar index (CI). Results indicate that the cortex of H. liberiensis shares one feature exclusively with cetaceans (the lack of layer IV across the entire cerebral cortex), other features exclusively with artiodactyls (e.g., the morphologiy of CR-immunoreactive multipolar neurons in deep cortical layers, gyrencephalic index values, hippocampus and cerebellum volumetrics), and others with at least some species of cetartiodactyls (e.g., the presence of a thick layer I, the pattern of distribution of CR-immunoreactive neurons, the presence of von Economo neurons, clustering of layer II in the occipital cortex). The present study thus provides a comprehensive dataset of the neuroanatomy of H. liberiensis that sets the ground for future comparative studies including the larger Hippopotamus amphibius.

    schema:about "Although neocortical neuronal morphology has been documented in the adult giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) and African elephant (Loxodonta africana), no research has explored the cortical architecture in newborns of these species. To this end, the current study examined the morphology of neurons from several cortical areas in the newborn giraffe and elephant. After cortical neurons were stained with a modified Golgi technique (N = 153), dendritic branching and spine distributions were analyzed by using computer-assisted morphometry. The results showed that newborn elephant neurons were considerably larger in terms of all dendritic and spine measures than newborn giraffe neurons. Qualitatively, neurons in the newborns appeared morphologically comparable to those in their adult counterparts. Neurons in the newborn elephant differed considerably from those observed in other placental mammals, including the giraffe, particularly with regard to the morphology of spiny projection neurons. Projection neurons were observed in both species, with a much larger variety in the elephant (e.g., flattened pyramidal, nonpyramidal multipolar, and inverted pyramidal neurons). Although local circuit neurons (i.e., interneurons, neurogliaform, Cajal-Retzius neurons) resembled those observed in other eutherian mammals, these were usually spiny, which contrasts with their adult, aspiny equivalents. Newborn projection neurons were smaller than the adult equivalents in both species, but newborn interneurons were approximately the same size as their adult counterparts. Cortical neuromorphology in the newborn giraffe is thus generally consistent with what has been observed in other cetartiodactyls, whereas newborn and adult elephant morphology appears to deviate substantially from what is commonly observed in other placental mammals.

    schema:about "The dopaminergic innervation of the striatum has been implicated in learning processes and in the development of human speech and language. Several lines of evidence suggest that evolutionary changes in dopaminergic afferents of the striatum may be associated with uniquely human cognitive and behavioral abilities, including the association of the human-specific sequence of the FOXP2 gene with decreased dopamine in the dorsomedial striatum of mice. To examine this possibility, we quantified the density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive axons as a measure of dopaminergic innervation within five basal ganglia regions in humans, great apes, and New and Old World monkeys. Our results indicate that humans differ from nonhuman primate species in having a significant increase in dopaminergic innervation selectively localized to the medial caudate nucleus. This region of the striatum is highly interconnected, receiving afferents from multiple neocortical regions, and supports behavioral and cognitive flexibility. The medial caudate nucleus also shows hyperactivity in humans lacking a functional FOXP2 allele and exhibits altered dopamine concentrations in humanized Foxp2 mice. Additionally, striatal dopaminergic input was not altered in chimpanzees that used socially learned attention-getting sounds versus those that did not. This evidence indicates that the increase in dopamine innervation of the medial caudate nucleus in humans is a species-typical characteristic not associated with experience-dependent plasticity. The specificity of this increase may be related to the degree of convergence from cortical areas within this region of the striatum and may also be involved in human speech and language.

    schema:about "Despite extensive investigations of the neocortex in the domestic cat, little is known about neuronal morphology in larger felids. To this end, the present study characterized and quantified the somatodendritic morphology of neocortical neurons in prefrontal, motor, and visual cortices of the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). After neurons were stained with a modified Golgi technique (N = 194), dendritic branching and spine distributions were analyzed using computer-assisted morphometry. Qualitatively, aspiny and spiny neurons in both species appeared morphologically similar to those observed in the domestic cat. Although the morphology of spiny neurons was diverse, with the presence of extraverted, inverted, horizontal, and multiapical pyramidal neurons, the most common variant was the typical pyramidal neuron. Gigantopyramidal neurons in the motor cortex were extremely large, confirming the observation of Brodmann ([1909] Vergleichende Lokalisationlehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues. Leipzig, Germany: J.A. Barth), who found large somata for these neurons in carnivores in general, and felids in particular. Quantitatively, a MARSplines analysis of dendritic measures differentiated typical pyramidal neurons between the Siberian tiger and the clouded leopard with 93% accuracy. In general, the dendrites of typical pyramidal neurons were more complex in the tiger than in the leopards. Moreover, dendritic measures in tiger pyramidal neurons were disproportionally large relative to body/brain size insofar as they were nearly as extensive as those observed in much larger mammals (e.g., African elephant). Comparison of neuronal morphology in a more diverse collection of larger felids may elucidate the comparative context for the relatively large size of the pyramidal neurons observed in the present study.

    schema:about "Cholinergic innervation of the basal ganglia is important in learning and memory. Striatal cholinergic neurons integrate cognitive and motivational states with behavior. Given these roles, it is not surprising that deficits in cortical cholinergic innervation have been correlated with loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Such evidence suggests the potential significance of subcortical cholinergic innervation in the evolution of the human brain. To compare humans with other closely related primates, the present study quantified axons and interneurons immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in regions of the executive and motor loops of the basal ganglia of humans, great apes, and monkeys. We also compared ChAT-immunoreactive (ir) interneuron morphological types among species within striatal regions. The results indicate that humans and great apes differ from monkeys in having a preponderance of multipolar ChAT-ir interneurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen, whereas monkeys have a more heterogeneous representation of multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar interneurons. Cholinergic innervation, as measured by axon and interneuron densities, did not differ across species in the medial caudate nucleus. Differences were detected in the dorsal caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus but the observed variation did not associate with the phylogenetic structure of the species in the sample. However, combining the present results with previously published data for dopamine revealed a unique pattern of innervation for humans, with higher amounts of dopamine compared with acetylcholine in the striatum. Taken together, these findings indicate a potential evolutionary shift in basal ganglia neurotransmission in humans that may favor increased synaptic plasticity. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc." ;

    schema:about "The amygdala is a medial temporal lobe structure implicated in social and emotional regulation. In typical development (TD), the amygdala continues to increase volumetrically throughout childhood and into adulthood, while other brain structures are stable or decreasing in volume. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the amygdala undergoes rapid early growth, making it volumetrically larger in children with ASD compared to TD children. Here we explore: (a) if dendritic arborization in the amygdala follows the pattern of protracted growth in TD and early overgrowth in ASD and (b), if spine density in the amygdala in ASD cases differs from TD from youth to adulthood. The amygdala from 32 postmortem human brains (7-46 years of age) were stained using a Golgi-Kopsch impregnation. Ten principal neurons per case were selected in the lateral nucleus and traced using Neurolucida software in their entirety. We found that both ASD and TD individuals show a similar pattern of increasing dendritic length with age well into adulthood. However, spine density is (a) greater in young ASD cases compared to age-matched TD controls (<18 years old) and (b) decreases in the amygdala as people with ASD age into adulthood, a phenomenon not found in TD. Therefore, by adulthood, there is no observable difference in spine density in the amygdala between ASD and TD age-matched adults (18 years old). Our findings highlight the unique growth trajectory of the amygdala and suggest that spine density may contribute to aberrant development and function of the amygdala in children with ASD." ;

    schema:about "Gigantopyramidal neurons, referred to as Betz cells in primates, are characterized by large somata and extensive basilar dendrites. Although there have been morphological descriptions and drawings of gigantopyramidal neurons in a limited number of species, quantitative investigations have typically been limited to measures of soma size. The current study thus employed two separate analytical approaches: a morphological investigation using the Golgi technique to provide qualitative and quantitative somatodendritic measures of gigantopyramidal neurons across 19 mammalian species from 7 orders; and unbiased stereology to compare the soma volume of layer V pyramidal and gigantopyramidal neurons in primary motor cortex between 11 carnivore and 9 primate species. Of the 617 neurons traced in the morphological analysis, 181 were gigantopyramidal neurons, with deep (primarily layer V) pyramidal (n=203) and superficial (primarily layer III) pyramidal (n=233) neurons quantified for comparative purposes. Qualitatively, dendritic morphology varied considerably across species, with some (sub)orders (e.g., artiodactyls, perissodactyls, feliforms) exhibiting bifurcating, V-shaped apical dendrites. Basilar dendrites exhibited idiosyncratic geometry across and within taxonomic groups. Quantitatively, most dendritic measures were significantly greater in gigantopyramidal neurons than in superficial and deep pyramidal neurons. Cluster analyses revealed that most taxonomic groups could be discriminated based on somatodendritic morphology for both superficial and gigantopyramidal neurons. Finally, in agreement with Brodmann, gigantopyramidal neurons in both the morphological and stereological analyses were larger in feliforms (especially in the Panthera species) than in other (sub)orders, possibly due to specializations in muscle fiber composition and musculoskeletal systems." ;

    schema:about "Under climate change, shrubs encroaching into high altitude plant communities disrupt ecosystem processes. Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. Overlap in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated Polemonium. To ascertain whether Salix interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing." ;

In Study I we use a standard compilation of culturally universal practices and show that the C dimension accounts for the majority of these universals, implying that the meaning of A traits varies more across cultures than that of C traits. In Studies 2 and 3, we provide evidence for this proposal using different judgment paradigms and cultural groups.

    schema:about "In coastal rivers, tides can propagate for tens to hundreds of kilometres inland beyond the saltwater line. Yet the influence of tides on river-aquifer connectivity and solute transport in tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) is largely unknown. We estimate that along the TFZ of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA), 11% of river water exchanges through tidal bank storage zones. Additional hyporheic processes such as flow through bedforms likely contribute even more exchange. The turnover length associated with tidal bank storage is 150 km, on the order of turnover lengths for all hyporheic exchange processes in non-tidal rivers of similar size. Based on measurements at a transect of piezometers located 17 km from the coast, tides exchange 0.36 m3 of water across the banks and 0.86 m3 across the bed per unit river length. Exchange fluxes range from -1.66 to 2.26 m day-1 across the bank and -0.84 to 1.88 m day-1 across the bed. During rising tide, river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer, and the downstream transport rate in the channel is low. During falling tide, stored groundwater is released to the river, and the downstream transport rate in the channel increases. Tidal bank storage zones may remove nutrients or other contaminants from river water and attenuate nutrient loads to coasts. Alternating expansion and contraction of aerobic zones in the riparian aquifer likely influence contaminant removal along flow paths. A clear need exists to understand contaminant removal and other ecosystem services in TFZs and adopt best management practices to promote these ecosystem services.

    schema:about "Abstract: An understanding of surface and subsurface water contributions to streamflow is essential for accurate predictions of water supply from mountain watersheds that often serve as water towers for downstream communities. As such, this study used the end-member mixing analysis technique to investigate source water contributions and hydrologic flow paths of the 264 km2 Boulder Creek Watershed, which drains the Colorado Front Range, USA. Four conservative hydrochemical tracers were used to describe this watershed as a 3 end-member system, and tracer concentration reconstruction suggested that the application of end-member mixing analysis was robust. On average from 2009 to 2011, snowmelt and rainwater from the subalpine zone and groundwater sampled from the upper montane zone contributed 54%, 22%, and 24% of the annual streamflow, respectively. These values demonstrate increased rainwater and decreased snow water contributions to streamflow relative to area-weighted mean values derived from previous work at the headwater scale. Young water (2.3 ??0.8 months) fractions of streamflow decreased from 18?22% in the alpine catchment to 8?10% in the lower elevation catchments and the watershed outlet with implications for subsurface storage and hydrological connectivity. These results contribute to a process-based understanding of the seasonal source water composition of a mesoscale watershed that can be used to extrapolate headwater streamflow generation predictions to larger spatial scales.

    schema:about "Research on depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) has suggested that PD patients experience a qualitatively different depression from that of other older adults, endorsing fewer cognitive symptoms of depression (e.g., guilt, failure) and greater somatic (e.g., poor sleep) and mood symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness); however, this has never been tested directly. In the present study, two PID groups, one with cognitive impairment (PD + Cl; n = 26) and one without cognitive impairment (PD; n = 45), and three control groups of older adults were compared on measures of depressive symptomatology. The control groups included a physically disabled group (n = 46), a cognitively impaired group (Cl; n = 21), and a healthy group (n = 50). Confirmatory factor analysis verified a four-factor model of depressive symptoms (Cognitive, Mood, Somatic, and Fatigue symptoms). Comparisons revealed that the PD group had a depressive-symptom pattern that was not significantly different from the disabled and healthy groups, The PD + Cl group had a symptom pattern that was more similar to the Cl group than to the PD group, Implications for the conceptualization of depression in older adults are discussed.

    schema:about "The debate over access to medicines has principally centered on pharmaceutical patents and prohibitively high drug prices. Although a less recognized problem, counterfeit pharmaceuticals are certainly a more insidious barrier to access. Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is an invisible threat, not only by nature, but also because the industry has historically downplayed it. However, that has changed. Pharmaceutical firms now not only readily concede counterfeiting is a threat to their business, but in some cases publicly address their strategies and the anticounterfeiting technologies in use and development. Acknowledging the problem has benefited the industry because it alters the ways in which firms are able to combat counterfeiting, allowing them to more overtly confront the problem. In addition, it allows them to better partner with governments and health advocates since their incentives are aligned in efforts to prevent counterfeiting. In light of the more public and more aggressive campaign against counterfeiting, it is important to examine the variety of strategies firms may utilize to prevent their sale. Through a theoretical model of the market in a representative developing country, several anticounterfeiting strategies are considered. Some strategies appear to be more effective than others in the battle against fake drugs. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

    schema:about "Although pharmaceutical counterfeiting incidents can be traced back thousands of years, it has been downplayed and even dismissed by pharmaceutical manufacturers in the past. That has changed. Pharmaceutical firms are newly dedicated to eradicate counterfeits globally and spending more money on anticounterfeiting efforts than ever before. The confluence of three factors seems to have drastically changed the existing paradigm for the pharmaceutical industry: increasing globalization, advancing technology, and the controversies surrounding the WTO Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and access to medicines. Given that counterfeit pharmaceuticals slip into the supply chain at every link, multinational pharmaceutical firms are searching for global solutions through increased interfirm cooperation along the supply chain. This research presents a theoretical model for characterizing the implications of these interventions on the motivations driving counterfeiters. The interventions are shown to increase the share of real pharmaceuticals and decrease the welfare losses attributable to counterfeiting. In practice, it is too early to evaluate the success of these new measures, but this research reflects on the extent of cooperation both across the supply chain and national boundaries and examines the likely long-run implications of these measures.

Well-preserved topo-type material from the classic Parahio Valley section is described for three species that have not previously been illustrated photographically. A biostratigraphical scheme based on Cambrian brachiopod occurrence is integrated with that recently proposed for trilobites. Regional correlations based on shared taxa within and across Himalayan lithotectonic belts demonstrate that erosion of Cambrian rocks in the Kurgiakh orogeny in the Parahio Valley removed little of the Parahio Formation and that all of the fossil-bearing lithotectonic zones share similar late early Cambrian brachiopods, suggesting regional faunal continuity at the time. Palaeobiogeographical analysis of the Cambrian brachiopod faunas from the Himalaya shows that they occupied a marginal position of the Australasian segment of Gondwana." ;

    schema:about "The central question in research on linguistic relativity, or the Whorfian hypothesis, is whether people who speak different languages think differently. The recent resurgence of research on this question can be attributed, in part, to new insights about the ways in which language might impact thought. We identify seven categories of hypotheses about the possible effects of language on thought across a wide range of domains, including motion, color, spatial relations, number, and false belief understanding. While we do not find support for the idea that language determines the basic categories of thought or that it overwrites preexisting conceptual distinctions, we do find support for the proposal that language can make some distinctions difficult to avoid, as well as for the proposal that language can augment certain types of thinking. Further, we highlight recent evidence suggesting that language may induce a relatively schematic mode of thinking. Although the literature on linguistic relativity remains contentious, there is growing support for the view that language has a profound effect on thought.

    schema:about "The Caenorhabditis elegans gene sup-26 encodes a well-conserved RNA-recognition motif-containing RNA-binding protein (RBP) that functions in dendrite morphogenesis of the PVD sensory neuron. The Drosophila ortholog of sup-26, alan shepard (shep), is expressed throughout the nervous system and has been shown to regulate neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis. Here, we extend these studies to show that sup-26 and shep are required for the development of diverse cell types within the nematode and fly nervous systems during embryonic and larval stages. We ascribe roles for sup-26 in regulating dendrite number and the expression of genes involved in mechanosensation within the nematode peripheral nervous system. We also find that in Drosophila, shep regulates dendrite length and branch order of nociceptive neurons, regulates the organization of neuronal clusters of the peripheral nervous system and the organization of axons within the ventral nerve cord. Taken together, our results suggest that shep/sup-26 orthologs play diverse roles in neural development across animal species. Moreover, we discuss potential roles for shep/sup-26 orthologs in the human nervous system." ;

To this end, the current study provides the first documentation of neuronal morphology in frontal and occipital regions of the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Cortical tissue from the perfusion-fixed brains of two free-ranging African elephants was stained with a modified Golgi technique. Neurons of different types (N = 75), with a focus on superficial (i.e., layers II-III) pyramidal neurons, were quantified on a computer-assisted microscopy system using Neurolucida software. Qualitatively, elephant neocortex exhibited large, complex spiny neurons, many of which differed in morphology/orientation from typical primate and rodent pyramidal neurons. Elephant cortex exhibited a V-shaped arrangement of bifurcating apical dendritic bundles. Quantitatively, the dendrites of superficial pyramidal neurons in elephant frontal cortex were more complex than in occipital cortex. In comparison to human supragranular pyramidal neurons, elephant superficial pyramidal neurons exhibited similar overall basilar dendritic length, but the dendritic segments tended to be longer in the elephant with less intricate branching. Finally, elephant aspiny interneurons appeared to be morphologically consistent with other eutherian mammals. The current results thus elaborate on the evolutionary roots of Afrotherian brain organization and highlight unique aspects of neural architecture in elephants." ;

    schema:about "The present quantitative study extends our investigation of cetartiodactyls by exploring the neuronal morphology in the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) neocortex. Here, we investigate giraffe primary visual and motor cortices from perfusion-fixed brains of three subadults stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Neurons (n = 244) were quantified on a computer-assisted microscopy system. Qualitatively, the giraffe neocortex contained an array of complex spiny neurons that included both \"typical\" pyramidal neuron morphology and \"atypical\" spiny neurons in terms of morphology and/or orientation. In general, the neocortex exhibited a vertical columnar organization of apical dendrites. Although there was no significant quantitative difference in dendritic complexity for pyramidal neurons between primary visual (n = 78) and motor cortices (n = 65), there was a significant difference in dendritic spine density (motor cortex > visual cortex). The morphology of aspiny neurons in giraffes appeared to be similar to that of other eutherian mammals. For cross-species comparison of neuron morphology, giraffe pyramidal neurons were compared to those quantified with the same methodology in African elephants and some cetaceans (e.g., bottlenose dolphin, minke whale, humpback whale). Across species, the giraffe (and cetaceans) exhibited less widely bifurcating apical dendrites compared to elephants. Quantitative dendritic measures revealed that the elephant and humpback whale had more extensive dendrites than giraffes, whereas the minke whale and bottlenose dolphin had less extensive dendritic arbors. Spine measures were highest in the giraffe, perhaps due to the high quality, perfusion fixation. The neuronal morphology in giraffe neocortex is thus generally consistent with what is known about other cetartiodactyls." ;

    schema:about "The present study documents the morphology of neurons in several regions of the neocortex from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the North Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Golgi-stained neurons (n = 210) were analyzed in the frontal and temporal neocortex as well as in the primary visual and primary motor areas. Qualitatively, all three species exhibited a diversity of neuronal morphologies, with spiny neurons including typical pyramidal types, similar to those observed in primates and rodents, as well as other spiny neuron types that had more variable morphology and/or orientation. Five neuron types, with a vertical apical dendrite, approximated the general pyramidal neuron morphology (i.e., typical pyramidal, extraverted, magnopyramidal, multiapical, and bitufted neurons), with a predominance of typical and extraverted pyramidal neurons. In what may represent a cetacean morphological apomorphy, both typical pyramidal and magnopyramidal neurons frequently exhibited a tri-tufted variant. In the humpback whale, there were also large, star-like neurons with no discernable apical dendrite. Aspiny bipolar and multipolar interneurons were morphologically consistent with those reported previously in other mammals. Quantitative analyses showed that neuronal size and dendritic extent increased in association with body size and brain mass (bottlenose dolphin < minke whale < humpback whale). The present data thus suggest that certain spiny neuron morphologies may be apomorphies in the neocortex of cetaceans as compared to other mammals and that neuronal dendritic extent covaries with brain and body size." ;

Approximately 90% of humans exhibit a right-hand preference, and the vast majority shows left-hemisphere dominance for language function. Although genetic models of human handedness and language have been proposed, the actual gene expression differences between cerebral hemispheres in humans remain to be fully defined. In the present study, gene expression profiles were examined in both hemispheres of three cortical regions involved in handedness and language in humans and their homologues in rhesus macaques: ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal cortex (STC), and primary motor cortex. Although the overall pattern of gene expression was very similar between hemispheres in both humans and macaques, weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed gene co-expression modules associated with hemisphere, which are different among the three cortical regions examined. Notably, a receptor-enriched gene module in STC was particularly associated with hemisphere and showed different expression levels between hemispheres only in humans." ;

    schema:about "Disturbances affect almost all terrestrial ecosystems, but it has been difficult to identify general principles regarding these influences. To improve our understanding of the long-term consequences of disturbance on terrestrial ecosystems, we present a conceptual framework that analyzes disturbances by their biogeochemical impacts. We posit that the ratio of soil and plant nutrient stocks in mature ecosystems represents a characteristic site property. Focusing on nitrogen (N), we hypothesize that this partitioning ratio (soil N: plant N) will undergo a predictable trajectory after disturbance. We investigate the nature of this partitioning ratio with three approaches: (1) nutrient stock data from forested ecosystems in North America, (2) a process-based ecosystem model, and (3) conceptual shifts in site nutrient availability with altered disturbance frequency. Partitioning ratios could be applied to a variety of ecosystems and successional states, allowing for improved temporal scaling of disturbance events. The generally short-term empirical evidence for recovery trajectories of nutrient stocks and partitioning ratios suggests two areas for future research. First, we need to recognize and quantify how disturbance effects can be accreting or depleting, depending on whether their net effect is to increase or decrease ecosystem nutrient stocks. Second, we need to test how altered disturbance frequencies from the present state may be constructive or destructive in their effects on biogeochemical cycling and nutrient availability. Long-term studies, with repeated sampling of soils and vegetation, will be essential in further developing this framework of biogeochemical response to disturbance." ;

In this research, we investigate the psychological reality of such a format, using simulated motion during scene processing?previously linked to schematization?as a diagnostic. One group of participants wrote a verbal description of a scene and then completed a change detection task assessing simulated motion, while another group completed only the latter task. We expected that effects of simulated motion would be stronger following language use than not, and specifically following the use of spatial, relative to non-spatial, language. Both predictions were supported. Further, the effect of language was scene independent, suggesting that language may encourage a general mode of schematic construal. The study and its findings illustrate a novel approach to examining the perceptual properties of mental representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "Tropical conservation and research focus primarily on protected areas and often ignore conservation values of surrounding agricultural lands. Understanding how species utilize agricultural land will maximize conservation efforts. We compared bird community composition in four habitats in northeastern Costa Rica: shade-grown cacao, live fences, riparian forest buffers, and preserved late-successional rainforest. Point counts over 2 months found 167 species from 36 families. Rainforest contained the most species unique to a habitat although richness per point was lower than in agricultural habitats. Half, 31, of the rainforest species did not occur in other habitats, while 106 species, mostly those preferring open areas, occurred in agroforest habitats but not rainforest. While agricultural habitats had fairly similar species composition to each other as determined by distance in an ordination, each also contained significant numbers, 9-30, of unique species. While intact rainforest remains central to conservation of tropical birds, agricultural lands with substantial trees, e.g., live fences, riparian buffers, and plantations with shade trees, can support a high richness of birds. These avian communities are not simply subsets of the rainforest species but include substantial numbers of unique species. Conservation contributions of these lands to species richness and complexity should be considered in conservation, and trees in these habitats preserved." ;

    schema:about "Several decades of research in alpine ecosystems have demonstrated links among the critical zone, hydrologic response, and the fate of elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Less research has occurred in mid-elevation forests, which may be important for retaining atmospheric N deposition. To explore the fate of N in the montane zone, we conducted plot-scale experimental rainfall events across a north-south transect within a catchment of the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory. Rainfall events mimicked relatively common storms (20-50% annual exceedance probability) and were labeled with N-15-nitrate () and lithium bromide tracers. For 4 weeks, we measured soil-water and leachate concentrations of Br-, and daily, followed by recoveries of N-15 species in bulk soils and microbial biomass. Tracers moved immediately into the subsurface of north-facing slope plots, exhibiting breakthrough at 10 and 30 cm over 22 days. Conversely, little transport of Br- or occurred in south-facing slope plots; tracers remained in soil or were lost via pathways not measured. Hillslope position was a significant determinant of soil N-15- recoveries, while soil depth and time were significant determinants of N-15 recovery in microbial biomass. Overall, N-15 recovery in microbial biomass and leachate was greater in upper north-facing slope plots than lower north-facing (toeslope) and both south-facing slope plots in August; by October, N-15 recovery in microbial N biomass within south-facing slope plots had increased substantially. Our results point to the importance of soil properties in controlling the fate of N in mid-elevation forests during the summer season." ;

For hyperbolic G, it is known that is bounded above by , which is known to be finite. For CAT(0) G, the latter quantity is also known to be finite, so one approach is to try proving a similar inequality. So far those efforts have failed. Motivated by these questions we work toward understanding the relationship between large scale dimension of CAT(0) groups and small scale dimension of the group's boundary by shifting attention to the linearly controlled dimension of the boundary. To do that, one must choose appropriate metrics for the boundaries. In this paper, we suggest two candidates and develop some basic properties. Under one choice, we show that linearly controlled dimension of the boundary remains finite; under another choice, we prove that macroscopic dimension of the group is bounded above by -. Other useful results are established, some basic examples are analyzed, and a variety of open questions are posed." ;

    schema:about "In many cities of the global North, city leaders are using greening as a way to compete in the globalized economy. Critiques of this development strategy typically focus on downtown areas, and many have noted that such processes often displace poor and working class people. Less studied are those areas that have not been fully incorporated into the postindustrial economy and where the struggles around social justice, economic development, and ecological restoration are still being played out. It is this insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this paper seeks to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact of the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South Seattle as case studies, this paper draws on previously unreported qualitative data to argue that community efforts to promote environmental justice in these areas have the potential to redefine practices of green economic growth to incorporate social equity and community coherence. However, their ability to do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging neoliberal discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening to benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the implications of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both developed and developing countries." ;

When prices are predetermined, the model becomes a monetary \"specific factor\" model. Intersectoral factor immobility complicates the optimal monetary policy problem by creating a tradeoff between stabilizing tradable and nontradable sector labor. When labor is mobile between sectors, policy coordination can significantly reduce labor volatility. When it is not mobile, coordination results in less volatility in tradable sector labor, but increased nontradable sector labor volatility." ;

    schema:about "Comments on the book, Political Emotions by Martha C. Nussbaum (2014). This book is a contribution to political philosophy and, simultaneously, a moral-psychological study of the emotions. Political Emotions is a remarkably successful book that combines several areas of philosophical research in which the author's proficiency is well known. It shows how problems that lie on the more intimate side of ethics, pertaining for instance to friendship and family life, have relevance for social justice and public culture; along the way, it also incorporates insightful readings of literary texts. For the sake of this book symposium, I concentrate mainly upon how human emotions are depicted and explained in Political Emotions, and on what Nussbaum's latest work reveals about her considered view about the nature of emotion. Her theory of emotion gets things right in the most important respects if, as she says, 'all my qualifications are taken duly into account'. Yet it would be a useful emendation if she could add one further qualification, by openly articulating a point that is already hinted at in Political Emotions.

    schema:about "Using survey data from Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients in Madison County, New York, we evaluate the effectiveness of the EITC in improving the economic well-being of low-income households. In particular, we examine the impact of the EITC across household types. For tax years 2002 through 2004, we find that the EITC is responsible for significantly lowering the poverty rate of EITC recipients, from 57 to 49%. In fact, for households below the poverty line, the EITC fills 31% of the gap between their adjusted gross income and the poverty line. The EITC has the largest impact on single parent households, lowering their poverty rate by 11.2 percentage points and reducing their poverty gap by almost 35%. However, the EITC has negligible effects on the poorest households in the sample-childless singles. A majority (64%) of EITC recipients intends to use at least some of the refund on basic needs and almost half plan on using part of their refund for debt repayment. This suggests that the EITC helps the majority of recipients get by but does not increase their economic mobility. Somewhat surprisingly, single parent households in the sample are not that different from married parent households in terms of EITC amounts, poverty rates, use of credit, and participation in government programs, despite earning less.

    schema:about "In his discourses on 'the lily of the field and the bird of the air,' Kierkegaard presents faith as the best possible response to our precarious and uncertain condition, and as the ideal way to cope with the insecurities and concerns that his readers will recognize as common features of human existence. Reading these discourses together, we are introduced to the portrait of a potential believer who, like the 'divinely appointed teachers'aEuro\"the lily and the bird-succeeds in leading a life that is full of care, but free of worry. Such a portrait, we claim, echoes Kierkegaard's portrait of the knight of faith in Fear and Trembling. In this essay we suggest that faith, as characterized in the 'lily and bird' discourses, is a kind of existential trust that would allow us to overcome worry, while remaining wholeheartedly engaged in the finite realm of our cares and concerns. We claim that Kierkegaard's goal in these discourses is not to belittle our earthly cares, but to invite us to develop a modified attitude toward all that we are susceptible to worry about." ;

Several studies have compared the public and private sectors in the dimension of values; but none have questioned the popular assumption that nonprofit and public managers share the same or a similar set of values or the value expectations they have for each other. This paper reports on the results of an empirical survey of public and nonprofit managers that compares their individual democratic, ethical, and professional values. In brief, the results lend strong support to the assumption that nonprofit employees share the same value set as their public sector counterparts; but their value sets do have statistically significant differences in the perceived level of importance of altruism, generosity, and individualism." ;

    schema:about "This paper explores the limitations of epistemic scientism for understanding the role the concept of race plays in assisted reproductive technology (ART) practices. Two major limitations centre around the desire to use scientific knowledge to bring about social improvement. In the first case, undue focus is placed on debunking the scientific reality of racial categories and characteristics. The alternative to this approach is to focus instead on the way the race idea functions in ART practices. Doing so reveals how the race idea (1) helps to define the reproductive \"problems\" different groups of women are experiencing and to dictate when and how they should be \"helped\"; (2) helps to resolve tensions about who should be considered the real parents of children produced by reproductive technologies; and (3) is used to limit ART use where that use threatens to denaturalize the very sociopolitical landscape the race idea has created. In the second case, scientific knowledge regarding reproduction is thought to call for technological control over that reproduction. This leads to an overemphasis on personal responsibility and a depoliticization of racialized social inequalities." ;

Discussions of the role that they can play in stimulating religious contemplation or even as sacred icons charged with power have also appeared in English scholarship.

This paper discusses how the founder of the Japanese school of Shingon Buddhism, the Buddhist monk Kukai of the ninth century, uses this term in a metaphorical sense to convey the transformed nature of awareness that is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice. Emphasis is also placed on the importance of metaphorical thinking to the religious path of transformation itself." ;

    schema:about "In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today's healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means \"health care in cyberspace\" - for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally - in neighborhoods, \"minute clinics,\" and homes - using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network - for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven \"pillars\" of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease. In this paper we discuss how Cybercare is being implemented now, and envision its growth by 2030." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: Daily-event precipitation samples collected in Underhill, VT from 1995 to 2006 were analyzed for total mercury and results suggest that there were no statistically significant changes in annual mercury wet deposition over time, despite significant emissions reductions in the Northeast United States. Meteorological analysis indicates that mercury deposition has not decreased as transport of emissions from major source regions in the Midwest and East Coast have consistently contributed to the largest observed mercury wet deposition amounts over the period. In contrast, annual volume-weighted mean (VWM) mercury concentration declined slightly over the 12-years, and a significant decrease was observed from CY 2001 to 2006. An increase in the total annual precipitation amount corresponded with the decline in annual VWM mercury concentration. Analysis suggests that the increase in precipitation observed was strongly related to changes in the amount and type of precipitation that fell seasonally, and this departure was attributed to a response in meteorological conditions to climate variability and the El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Increased amounts of rainfall and mixed precipitation (mixture of rainfall and snowfall), particularly in the spring and fall seasons, enhanced annual precipitation amounts and resulted in declining VWM mercury concentrations during these periods. Thus, declines in concentration at the more remote Underhill site appear to be more directly linked to local scale meteorological and climatological variability than to a reduction in emissions of mercury to the atmosphere.

Over the 12-year period, annual Hg deposition levels at Underhill did not decline significantly despite regulatory efforts to reduce Hg emissions in the United States. Mercury and trace element wet deposition data were examined using the multivariate receptor model EPA PMF 3.0 to identify the sources contributing to Hg deposition at the Underhill site. Results indicate that coal combustion, a mixture of incineration and non-ferrous metal smelting, and a phosphorus source contributed to the observed Hg wet deposition. The model consistently indicated that coal combustion contributed ~60% of the total Hg measured in wet deposition and the contribution from this source did not change significantly over time. Mercury and trace element deposition were further analyzed using a hybrid-receptor model, quantitative transport bias analysis (QTBA), to identify the likely source locations contributing to Hg deposition. Results from QTBA indicate that the majority of Hg deposition at Underhill is due to transport from the Midwestern United States, where the density of coal-fired utility boilers in the U.S. is largest.

    schema:about "Atmospheric emissions from the Chicago/Gary urban/industrial area significantly enhance ambient mercury (Hg) concentrations and lead to increased levels of atmospheric Hg deposition within the Lake Michigan Basin. We use airborne observations collected over Lake Michigan during the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) campaign to quantify the outflow of total Hg (THg) emissions from the Chicago/Gary urban/industrial area. We use concurrent airborne measurements of THg, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) to calculate measured enhancement ratios and to characterize Chicago/Gary emissions with respect to the 2011 U.S. EPA National Emissions Inventory. We determine the observed THg/CO enhancement ratio in outflow from Chicago/Gary to be 0.21 +/- 0.09 x 10(-6) mol mol(-1) (ppqv/ppbv), which is comparable to observations reported for other major U.S. urban/industrial areas. We also employ the FLEXPART Lagrangian transport and dispersion model to simulate air mass transport during plume encounters and to compare our observations to inventoried emission ratios. We find that our observed THg/CO enhancement ratios are 63-67% greater than the transport-corrected emission ratios for the Chicago/Gary area. Our results suggest that there are many small emission sources that are not fully accounted for within the inventory, and/or that the re-emission of legacy Hg is a significant source of THg to the atmosphere in this region.

    schema:about "Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 80(1) of Brain and Cognition (see record rid]2012-20606-019/rid]). In the original article, in the caption to Fig. 4, the first sentence labels the Happy and Angry tasks incorrectly. The sentence should read: 'Mean dRT for facial expressions in Experiment 3 on Happy (dark circles; solid regression line) and Angry (light circles; dashed regression line) tasks (first task completed only).'] Converging behavioral and neural evidence suggests that numerical representations are mentally organized in left-to-right orientation. Here we show that this format of spatial organization extends to emotional expression. In Experiment 1, right-side responses became increasingly faster as number (represented by Arabic numerals) or happiness (depicted in facial stimuli) increased, for judgments completely unrelated to magnitude. Additional experiments suggest that magnitude (i.e., more/less relations), not valence (i.e., positive/negative), underlies left-to-right orientation of emotional expression (Experiment 2), and that this orientation accommodates to the context-relevant emotion (e.g., happier faces are more rightward when judged on happiness, but more leftward when judged on angriness; Experiment 3). These findings show that people automatically extract magnitude from a variety of stimuli, representing such information in common left-to-right format, perhaps reflecting a mental magnitude line. We suggest that number is but one dimension in a hyper-general representational system uniting disparate dimensions of magnitude and likely subserved by common neural mechanisms in posterior parietal cortex.

    schema:about "Adding charcoal to soil (biochar soil amendment) can sequester carbon and improve soil performance, although the extent and exact mechanisms of soil improvement are not clear. Additionally, biochar properties can vary significantly with production conditions. Here we characterize the impact of pyrolysis temperature on two important soil hydrologic properties: field capacity and hydrophobicity. We show that pure biochar exhibits a wide range in both properties depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. We find that both properties can be controlled by choice of pyrolysis temperature; 400 degrees C-600 degrees C produced biochars with the most desirable hydrological properties (peak field capacity and minimum hydrophobicity). Further, we show that hydrophobicity is strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.87; p < 0.001) to the presence of alkyl functionalities in FTIR spectra, suggesting that this property derives from aliphatic domains on the surface of low-temperature biochars. Although we could relate hydrophobicity to biochar chemistry, our chemical characterization techniques were insufficient to describe variation in field capacity of soil-biochar mixtures. Field capacity may be related to large biochar pores, suggesting the need for quantitative techniques to characterize large (greater than 0.1 mu m) pores within biochar particles.

    schema:about "Partitioning of chromosomes into euchromatic and heterochromatic domains requires mechanisms that specify boundaries. The S. pombe JmjC family protein Epe1 prevents the ectopic spread of heterochromatin and is itself concentrated at boundaries. Paradoxically, Epe1 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 silencing factors that are distributed throughout heterochromatin. We demonstrate here that the selective enrichment of Epe1 at boundaries requires its regulation by the conserved Cul4-Ddb1(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase, which directly recognizes Epe1 and promotes its polyubiquitylation and degradation. Strikingly, in cells lacking the ligase, Epe1 persists in the body of heterochromatin thereby inducing a defect in gene silencing. Epe1 is the sole target of the Cul4-Ddb1(Cdt2) complex whose destruction is necessary for the preservation of heterochromatin. This mechanism acts parallel with phosphorylation of HP1/Swi6 by CK2 to restrict Epe1. We conclude that the ubiquitin-dependent sculpting of the chromosomal distribution of an antisilencing factor is critical for heterochromatin boundaries to form correctly." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: There is a gender imbalance in undergraduate economics departments with most departments educating a strong majority of young men. This imbalance has led many economists to ponder the question of why relatively few women choose to take courses and major in economics. Our hypothesis is that the gender imbalance in undergraduate economics, particularly at institutions with traditional liberal arts curriculums, is partly explained by women''s greater sensitivity to grades, particularly lower grades. Students choose their majors based on both their interests and their abilities. The literature indicates that the grade a student receives in an introductory class relative to grades received in other departments is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not the student chooses to enroll in more courses in the discipline. However, our hypothesis is that men who take economics courses are less responsive to this signal than are women. As a result, men who do poorly in economics are more likely to continue in the major. Women who do poorly, in contrast, are more likely to abandon economics and pursue a different major. Our results, generated from 16 years of data from a liberal arts college where economics is one of the most popular majors, support this hypothesis. The overall economics GPA for female majors is significantly higher than that for males and male students dominate the bottom of the grade distribution. Finally, results from the estimation of a series of selection models of the decision to take more economics courses indicate that, holding other characteristics constant, women are more responsive to the relative grade received than are men.

A liquid gallium electrode was used to drive the electroreduction of Sb 2 O 3 dissolved in 0.6 M NaOH. The quality and purity of the resultant films produced depended strongly on the chosen conditions, including temperature, time, and concentration of dissolved Sb 2 O 3 . Under select conditions, the direct production of polycrystalline films of GaSb was possible. Raman spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were separately used to analyze the identity and crystallinity of the electrodeposited films. The cumulative data showed that this electrodeposition process followed the features common both to conventional electrodeposition and melt crystal growth. Accordingly, this electrodeposition process could not be categorized as electrodeposition followed by annealing. Rather, the data implicate this method is akin to a hybrid electrodeposition solution-based crystal growth, where crystalline GaSb films could be grown up to thicknesses of 1 m in 60 min.

Cambrian deposits of this \"upper Lesser Himalayan\" succession, which include deposits of the \"outer\" Lesser Himalaya tectonic unit, are enriched in radiogenic Os-187. They make up part of a proximal marine fades belt that extends onto the craton and along strike from India to Pakistan. By contrast, age-equivalent facies in the Tethyan Himalaya are more distal in nature. Neoproterozoic to Cambrian strata of the upper Lesser Himalayan succession are now missing in much of the Lesser Himalaya, with their erosion exposing older Precambrian Lesser Himalayan strata. We suggest that exhumation and weathering of the upper Lesser Himalaya and related strata caused dramatic changes in the Os-187/Os-188 and Sr-87/Sr-86 Neogene record of seawater starting at similar to 16 Ma. First-order estimates for the volume of upper Himalayan strata, as well as the volume of all LH rock eroded since this time, and geochemical box modeling, support this idea. Exhumation at 16 Ma is a fundamental event in the evolution of the Himalayan orogeny and the geochemical evolution of the oceans, and will be a critical part of the construction of future models of Himalayan thrust belt evolution.

    schema:about "Intraplate strain generally focuses in discrete zones, but despite the profound impact of this partitioning on global tectonics, geodynamics, and seismic hazard, the processes by which deformation becomes localized are not well understood. Such heterogeneous intraplate strain is exemplified in central Asia, where the Indo-Eurasian collision has caused widespread deformation while the Tarim block has experienced minimal Cenozoic shortening. The apparent stability of Tarim may arise either because strain is dominantly accommodated by pre-existing faults in the continental suture zones that bound it -- essentially discretizing Eurasia into microplates -- or because the lithospheric-scale strength (i.e., viscosity) of the Tarim block is greater than its surroundings. Here, we jointly analyze seismic velocity, gravity, topography, and temperature to develop a 3-D density model of the crust and upper mantle in this region. The Tarim crust is characterized by high density, v s , v p , and v p / v s , consistent with a dominantly mafic composition and with the presence of an oceanic plateau beneath Tarim. Low-density but high-velocity mantle lithosphere beneath southern (southwestern) Tarim underlies a suite of Permian plume-related mafic intrusions and A-type granites sourced in previously depleted mantle lithosphere; we posit that this region was further depleted, dehydrated, and strengthened by Permian plume magmatism. The actively deforming western and southern margins of Tarim -- the Tien Shan, Kunlun Shan, and Altyn Tagh fault -- are underlain by buoyant upper mantle with low velocity; we hypothesize that this material has been hydrated by mantle-derived fluids that have preferentially migrated along Paleozoic continental sutures. Such hydrous material should be weak, and herein strain focuses there because of lithospheric-scale variations in rheology rather than the pre-existence of faults in the brittle crust. Thus this world-class example of strain partitioning arises not simply from the pre-existence of brittle faults but from the thermo-chemical and therefore rheological variations inherited from prior tectonism.

Provenancing of human remains using isotopes has been hindered by a lack of appropriate isoscapes, by changes in these isoscapes over time, and by various homogenization processes. In this study we create spatiotemporal isoscapes for anthropogenic lead (Pb) for the contiguous United States and Europe using literature data from dated sediments, soils and biological tissues. We compare Pb-206/Pb-207 isoscapes with isoscapes of delta C-13, delta O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86 to determine their relative efficacy for the forensic identification of human remains. We do this comparison using third molar enamel data from 22 United States Air Force Academy cadets with known life trajectories born between 1983 and 1985.

    schema:about "RFX transcription factors are master regulators of ciliogenesis in diverse animal species. The sole Caenorhabditis elegans RFX homolog, DAF-19, plays at least two roles in the formation of functional cilia. The DAF-19(c) isoform is required for ciliogenesis and the DAF-19(m) isoform is required for the functional specialization of a subset of male-specific ciliated neurons called PKD neurons. Here we report the identification of a novel mutation, daf19(sm129), which disrupts the functional specification of PKD neurons and thus suggests that daf-19m activity is compromised. However, ciliogenesis is not disrupted in daf-19(sm129) mutants suggesting that daf-19c activity is retained. The sm129 mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site adjacent to an exon common to the daf-19c and daf-19m isoforms resulting in aberrant splicing in a proportion of transcripts. While aberrant splicing of daf-19c to upstream cryptic sites results in in-frame and functional products, a large proportion of daf-19m mRNAs include the entire upstream intron, which introduces a frameshift and stop codons. At least 15% of disease-causing mutations affect splicing of the gene bearing the mutation, thus it is important to understand the consequences of splice site mutations on gene function. However, predicting the effects of a splice site mutation remains difficult and experimental determination is still required. Using daf-19(sm129) as a model, our results suggest that this problem is exacerbated when a splice acceptor mutation is used by multiple isoforms of the same gene because the effects on each isoform can be dramatically different.

    schema:about "At different times during recent human evolution, northern Africa has served as a conduit for migrations from the Arabian Peninsula. Although previous researchers have investigated the possibility of the Strait of Gibraltar as a pathway of migration from North Africa to Iberia, we now revisit this issue and theorize that although the Strait of Gibraltar, at the west end of this corridor, has acted as a barrier for human dispersal into Southwest Europe, it has not provided an absolute seal to gene flow. To test this hypothesis, here we use the spatial frequency distributions, STR diversity and expansion time estimates of Y chromosome haplogrotipsil J1-P58 and E-M81 to investigate the genetic imprints left by the Arabian and Berber expansions into the Iberian Peninsula, respectively. The data generated indicate that Arabian and Berber genetic markers are detected in Iberia. We present evidence that suggest that Iberia has received gene flow from Northwest Africa during and prior to the Islamic colonization of 711 A.D. It is interesting that the highest frequencies of Arabia and Berber markers are not found in southern Spain, where Islam remained the longest and was culturally most influential, but in Northwest Iberia, specifically Galicia. We propose that Moriscos' relocations to the north during the Reconquista, the migration of cryptic Muslims seeking refuge in a more lenient society and/or more geographic extensive pre-Islamic incursions may explain the higher frequencies and older time estimates of mutations in the north of the Peninsula. These scenarios are congruent with the higher diversities of some diagnostic makers observed in Northwest Iberia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "At an average altitude of 4000 m above sea level, the Tibetan plateau is one of the highest plains on the planet. It is surrounded on three sides by massive mountain ranges: the Kunlun, the Karakoram and the Himalayas. These natural barriers have kept Tibet relatively isolated. In the present study, 15 autosomal STR loci were genotyped in 338 unrelated individuals from three traditional provinces of historical Tibet: Amdo (86), Kham (101) and U-Tsang (151). All the studied loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for the D19S433 locus in the Kham province. FGA, D21S11 and D2S1338 show the highest observed heterozygosity values in Amdo (0.8954), Kham (0.9208) and U-Tsang (0.8940), respectively, whereas TPOX is the least variable marker displaying the lowest value for the same parameter. U-Tsang exhibits the highest total numbers of alleles (139) followed by Kham (130) and Amdo (128) groups. The allele frequency data from this study were compared to relevant global reference populations. Our results indicate that although these three Tibetan populations group together in both the Correspondence Analysis (CA) plot and the Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree, they exhibit some degree of genetic differentiation among themselves congruent with their unique dialects, cultures and traditions. The 15 autosomal STR loci studied were found to be informative and discriminating, thereby providing a useful set of markers for population genetic studies.

    schema:about "Notwithstanding the general interest and the geopolitical importance of the island countries in the Greater Antilles, little is known about the specific ancestral Native American and African populations that settled them. In an effort to alleviate this lacuna of information on the genetic constituents of the Greater Antilles, we comprehensively compared the mtDNA compositions of Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. To accomplish this, the mtDNA HVRI and HVRII regions, as well as coding diagnostic sites, were assessed in the Haitian general population and compared to data from reference populations. The Taino maternal DNA is prominent in the ex-Spanish colonies (61.3%-22.0%) while it is basically non-existent in the ex-French and ex English colonies of Haiti (0.0%) and Jamaica (0.5%), respectively. The most abundant Native American mtDNA haplogroups in the Greater Antilles are A2, B2 and C1. The African mtDNA component is almost fixed in Haiti (98.2%) and Jamaica (98.5%), and the frequencies of specific African haplogroups vary considerably among the five island nations. The strong persistence of Taino mtDNA in the ex-Spanish colonies (and especially in Puerto Rico), and its absence in the French and English excolonies is likely the result of different social norms regarding mixed marriages with Taino women during the early years after the first contact with Europeans. In addition, this article reports on the results of an integrative approach based on mtDNA analysis and demographic data that tests the hypothesis of a southward shift in raiding zones along the African west coast during the period encompassing the Transatlantic Slave Trade." ;

    schema:about "International agricultural carbon market projects face significant challenges in delivering greenhouse gas mitigation objectives whilst also seeking to provide additional benefits for poverty alleviation. The carbon credit producer (the smallholder farmer) and carbon credit buyer in the carbon market transaction typically operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Buyers operate at a global scale, responding to opportunities for financial speculation and both private and public climate action plans. Farmers operate within households, farms, and immediate agricultural landscapes, pursuing livelihood and food security needs. These different scales often result in mismatches of timing, payment, and knowledge in market transactions and can be partially rectified by project developers who serve to broker the relationship between the farmers and the buyers. We examined eight East African agricultural carbon market projects to determine how project developers function as bridging organizations and minimize the mismatches between these actors. Results show that projects better bridged the timing and payment gap between buyers and producers when project developers provided non-monetary benefits or direct monetary assistance to farmers. However, knowledge gaps remained a significant barrier for farmers wishing to participate in the market. We discuss how project developers brokered relationships in ways that reflected their interests and highlight the limitations, trade-offs, and challenges that must be overcome if win-win outcomes of poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation are to be realized.

    schema:about "The paper uses individual level data from each student that has enrolled in each class in the department in the last five years. Unlike several past studies that lack data on teaching quality measures Ordered Probit models reveal that the significant determinants of effective teaching, based on student evaluations of teaching (SET) are: organization, clarity of exposition, availability and enthusiasm of the instructor. The gender and race of the instructor is significant with female and non-white instructors being downgraded by students. The usual findings of expected grades inflating teaching evaluations are contested by the empirical evidence from this paper. Highly selective liberal arts colleges claim to provide a better education based on smaller class sizes and excellent teachers that are also active scholars. The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of effective teaching in Economics and Business, according to student evaluations of teaching (SET) at one such college. The paper will begin with a literature review of the scholarship on teaching evaluations. The next section will describe the dataset and the models used to examine teaching effectiveness. The paper will conclude with a discussion of the econometric results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

Simulations demonstrate that explanations of the results using large IDs based on the hypothesis of a \"zone of speculative inactivity\" are inconsistent with empirical evidence. Furthermore, it is shown that, if agents forecast IDs based on long-run values, coefficient estimates will be unstable if rates of decay in IDs vary significantly and, for ex post UIP to hold, IDs must decay in absolute value. This is consistent with OECD country data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "Background: Internationally, depression is a common psychological disorder whose treatment depends upon its identification by treating professionals as well as patient utilization of mental health care systems: the latter often being hampered by cultural differences between patients and health professionals. Method: The current study used vignettes of depressed patients which varied the culture and/or social circumstances of the patient to assess whether these variables influenced the conceptualization of depression and its treatment. Participants (N=722) included mental health professionals, lay people, immigrants, and refugees in Norway. Results: We found that immigrants and refugees, particularly those of non-western origin, endorsed different types of depression treatments from native Norwegians and mental health professionals, and judged who deserved treatment and who was overreacting based on the patient's culture and social circumstances, while native Norwegians did not. Limitations: While widely used cross-culturally, vignette methodology is limited in its generalizability to real clinical situations. Acculturation was not evaluated, which may have influenced the results. Conclusions: Findings support the integration of cultural competency ideals not only into treatment, but also into public health promotions of mental health services for lay people.

We explore the problem of statistically assessing the correspondence between episodes of extreme climate (such as droughts) and cultural events (such as depopulation) they are purported to explain. In order to do this: 1) We describe a method that permits the objective identification of climate extremes in a way that is independent of their supposed causal outcomes; 2) We discuss how we identify and date cultural transitions of interest; 3) We explore a variety of decision rules for determining whether or not there is a match between a given extreme climate interval and the interval during which a transition began: and 4) We propose an intuitive Monte Carlo approach to statistically assess the observed correspondence between the climate extremes and the cultural transitions. Our application does not indicate statistical support for a linkage between intervals of extreme climate and major transitions in any of the seven cultural traditions in the Southwest US that we examined.

We study the short run effects of the arrival of democracy on different measures of women's empowerment by exploiting exogenous variation in the government through abolition of the monarchy. This paper employs a propensity score matching estimator to evaluate the linkage between change in political regime and opinions related to women's empowerment from 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). Results show that women's say in decision making increased significantly, and opinions on violence against women strengthened. We further scrutinize the treatment effect estimates with Rosenbaum bounds and observe if they are sensitive to possible hidden selection bias. We also test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect across gender and find that males report higher probability of mutual household decision-making among couples than females.

    schema:about "In this research the outcome of an affective priming experiment is shown to critically depend on the frequency of occurrence of the target words used. Low frequency target words (5.7 occurrences per million words) resulted in an affective congruency effect, i.e., faster responses following affectively congruent than incongruent primes. High frequency target words (32.6 occurrences per million) resulted in a reverse priming effect, i.e., faster responses following incongruent than congruent primes. The size of the congruency effect was larger than the size of the reverse priming effect, thus masking its emergence when word frequency was not taken into account. We propose that target word frequency has its influence via an accessibility-related mechanism having to do with differences in observed changes in affect between prime and target.

Realizing that the fluorinated thiochroman-4-ones are important scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are rare in the chemical literature, one-pot synthesis of 2-/3-(trifluoromethyl)thiochroman-4-ones was attempted. Direct access to 2-/3-(trifluoromethyl) thiochroman-4-ones was achieved by a tandem allcylation-cyclic acylation process promoted by superelectrophilic activation of 2-/3-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid in superacidic trifluoromethanesulfonic acid under microwave-assisted Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzenethiols followed by cyclization (via intramolecular acylation). Synthesis of a series of 2-13-(trifluoromethyl)thiochroman-4-ones from protosolvated 2-/3-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid intermediates and benzenethiols is described. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

    schema:about "Purpose Lag screw fixation is reported to provide the most biomechanically stable construct for fixation of oblique or spiral metacarpal fractures. Lac, screws are inserted after overdrilling the proximal cortex, resulting in compression at the fracture site. Minor drilling errors an result in poor screw purchase, instability, and ultimately impaired fracture healing. In an in vitro study, we compared construct stability provided by nonlagged and lagged screw fixation. Methods A cadaveric human metacarpal model was used. After removing the soft tissue, long oblique osteotomies were made in 24 metacarpals, which were then randomized to lagged or nonlagged fixation. Nonlagged fixation was performed through a newly introduced reduction system. Fixed specimens were subjected to biomechanical analysis by way of cantilevered bending to failure, and calculations were made for axial stress and normalized stiffness. Results All specimens failed in a typical manner through the proximal screw site. Nonlagged compared with lagged screw fixation resulted in a higher axial stress and normalized stiffness, althouch the differences did not reach statistical significance. Condusions Nonlagged screw fixation with use of a precompression device provided cornparable fracture site stiffness and biomechanical stability Without use of lag screws while removing the requirement for overdrilling, thus simplifying the technique.

    schema:about "Summary. The amendment of soil with biochar can sequester carbon and alter hydrologic properties by changing physical and chemical characteristics of soil. To understand the effect of biochar amendment on soil hydrology, we measured the hydraulic conductivity ( K ) of biocharâ€“sand mixtures as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachate. Specifically, we assessed the effects of biochar concentration and particle size on K and amount of DOC in the soil leachate. To better understand how physical properties influenced K , we also measured the skeletal density of biochars and sand, and the bulk density, the water saturation, and the porosity of biocharâ€“sand mixtures. Our model soil was sand (0.251â€“0.853 mm) with biochar rates from 2 to 10 wt% (g biochar/g total soil Ã— 100%). As biochar (&lt;0.853 mm) concentration increased from 0 to 10 wt%, K decreased by 72 Â± 3%. When biochar particle size was equal to, greater than, and less than particle size of sand, we found that biochar in different particle sizes have different effects on K . For a 2 wt% biochar rate, K decreased by 72 Â± 2% when biochar particles were finer than sand particles, and decreased by 15 Â± 2% when biochar particles were coarser than sand particles. When biochar and sand particle size were comparable, we observed no significant effect on K . We propose that the decrease of K through the addition of fine biochar was because finer biochar particles filled spaces between sand particles, which increased tortuosity and reduced pore throat size of the mixture. The decrease of K associated with coarser biochar was caused by the bimodal particle size distribution, resulting in more compact packing and increased tortuosity. The loss of biochar C as DOC was related to both biochar rate and particle size. The cumulative DOC loss was 1350% higher from 10 wt% biochar compared to pure sand. This large increase reflected the very small DOC yield from pure sand. In addition, DOC in the leachate decreased as biochar particle size increased. For all treatments, the fraction of carbon lost as DOC ranged from 0.06 to 0.18 wt% of biochar. These experiments suggest that mixing sandy soils with biochar is likely to reduce infiltration rates, holding water near the surface longer with little loss of biochar-derived carbon to groundwater and streams.

An international real business cycle model is used to demonstrate that real exchange rate volatility increases if (i) it is costly to move labor between sectors and (ii) the consumption of tradable goods requires distribution services. Model dynamics are generated by shocks to productivity and preferences based on sectoral output, employment and consumption data from G-7 countries. The introduction of intersectoral adjustment and distribution costs substantially increases the real exchange rate volatility generated by the model. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "This paper uses a unique new monthly US-UK real exchange rate series for the January 1794-December 2009 period to reexamine the academic debate over purchasing power parity (PPP). The consensus view described by Rogoff (1996) is that PPP holds in the long-run, but short-run deviations are very persistent, with half-lives ranging from 3 to 5 years. Most of the literature using long time series relies on the annual data developed by Lee (1976) and Lothian and Taylor (1996), which were both constructed from underlying higher-frequency data sources. Estimates of purchasing power parity persistence using these series may therefore be subject to temporal aggregation bias. We find evidence of aggregation bias which indicates the half-life of PPP deviations has been overestimated in much of the previous literature. We also find that estimates of the half-lives are further reduced once we account for the Harrod (1933)-Balassa (1964)Samuelson (1964) effect. The result of aggregation bias appears to be robust even when considering the case that real exchange rates exhibit nonlinear dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "This paper employs structural vector autoregression methods to examine the contribution of real and nominal shocks to real exchange rate movements using two hundred and seventeen years of data from Britain and the United States. Shocks are identified with long-run restrictions. The long time series makes possible an investigation of how the role of nominal shocks has evolved over time due to changes in the shock processes or to structural changes in the economy which might alter how a shock is transmitted to the real exchange rate. The sample is split at 1913, which is the end of the classical gold standard period, the last of the monetary regimes of the 19th century. The earlier subsample (1795-1913) shows a much stronger role for nominal shocks in explaining real exchange rate movements than the later subsample (1914-2010). Counterfactual analysis shows that the difference between the two periods is mainly due to the size of the nominal shocks rather than structural changes in the economy. These findings are consistent with the view that the financial instability and frequent deflation of the 19th century had real economic effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "A critical issue in quantitative neuromorphology is the accuracy and subsequent reliability of the tracing techniques employed to characterize neuronal components. Historically, the camera lucida was the only option for such investigations. In 1987, MBF Bioscience, Inc. (Williston, VT) developed the integrative Neurolucida computer-microscope system, replacing the camera lucida drawing tube with a Lucivid cathode ray tube, thereby allowing computer overlays directly on the view through microscope oculars. Subsequent advances in digital cameras have allowed the Lucivid system to be replaced so that microscope images can be traced by viewing the digital image on a computer monitor. Indeed, the camera systems now outsell Lucivid systems 9 to 1 (J. Glaser, personal communication, 08/2008). Nevertheless, researchers seldom note which of these configurations are being used (which may confound the accuracy of data sharing), and there have been no published comparisons of the Lucivid and camera configurations. The present study thus assesses the relative accuracy of these two hardware configurations by examining reconstructions of human pyramidal neurons. We report significant differences with respect to dendritic spines, with the camera estimates of spine counts being greater than those obtained with the Lucivid system. Potential underlying reasons (e.g., magnification, illumination, and resolution, as well as observer ergonomic differences between the two systems) for these quantitative findings are explored here, along with qualitative observations on the relative strengths of each configuration.

We investigate the role of self-esteem in determining wages directly and indirectly via education. We use data from the 1979 wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79) to estimate a three equation simultaneous equation model that treats self-esteem, educational attainment, and real wages as endogenous. We find that, while self-esteem has a positive and significant impact on wages indirectly via education, it does not significantly affect wages directly once we control for locus of control. We find that the indirect effect of self-esteem comprises upwards of 80% of the total effect of self-esteem on wages after 1980. Additionally, we find that wages and education both affect self-esteem. We discuss gender differences in the relationships between wages, education, and self-esteem and conclude that females experience a higher rate of return on education than males, and self-esteem is a stronger determinant of educational attainment for males than females.

    schema:about "Classic economic theory assumes that time preference is a stable parameter. However, a large literature in psychology theory suggests that initial exertions of self-control affect one's ability to deploy self-control subsequently. As savings decisions require individuals to make trade-offs between immediate gratification and future rewards, the self-control literature suggests that expression of time preference is susceptible to environmental influences, a contradiction of the neoclassical stability assumption. Empirical evidence is mixed. This paper proposes that self-control use has heterogeneous effects on the expression of economic time preference. Using a Stroop task to experimentally induce self-control fatigue in university students in Northern Ethiopia, we find that treated subjects with below median finances behave more impatiently in an incentivized time preference task than do untreated subjects. By contrast, treated relatively wealthy students do not behave differently than their untreated counterparts. Our results suggest that the psychological environment does affect the expression of time preference, but self-control use does not uniformly deplete patience for all subjects. Our results are most consistent with the process model of self-control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "The spread of HIV and AIDS and risky sexual behavior continues to be a problem in Sub-Saharan African countries despite government measures to educate people on the risk and severity of the disease and measures to promote safe sex practices such as making condoms readily available at reduced or no cost. We examine whether people decide to engage in risky sexual behavior due to low income and low life expectancy. Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by conditions that significantly reduce life expectancy such as unsanitary conditions prevalent in poverty stricken areas, inaccessibility to health care, and dangerous working conditions such as those in very poor mining regions. Moreover, since income per capita in these countries is very low, the opportunity cost associated with dying from AIDS and foregoing future consumption is very low. We examine how a government provided life insurance benefit may be an effective means of deterring risky sexual behavior. To evaluate this policy prescription we develop a life-cycle model with personal and family consumption and endogenous probability of survival. In the model, agents can receive life insurance benefits if their death is not the result of AIDS. We demonstrate that excessive risky behavior does result from low life expectancy and low levels of income and illustrate the conditions for which the life insurance benefit can replicate the effects of higher income and life expectancy, deterring risky sexual behavior and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS.

    schema:about "New and published stratigraphic data are integrated herein to resolve the age and depositional setting of Middle Devonian strata in the Gobi-Altai Terrane of south-central Mongolia (Bayanhongar Province). The Tsagaankhaalga Formation (Emsian?-Eifelian) is composed primarily of tabular sandy carbonates; it is sharply overlain by dark, fine-grained volcanoclastic marine sedimentary rock of the Govialtai Formation (Givetian), which is comparatively unfossiliferous, except for sporadic, fossiliferous carbonate interbeds. The latter unit contains abundant tentaculites as well as a newly recovered collection of conodonts assigned to the lower Givetian varcus Zone (timorensis, rhenana, or ansatus). A positive shift in bulk magnetic susceptibility coincides with the Tsagaankhaalga/Govialtai contact, and elevated values within the Govialtai correspond to tuffaceous and rhyolitic strata. The transition from carbonate facies of the Tsagaankhaalga Formation to the volcanoclastic shales of the Govialtai Formation is interpreted as the result of local tectonic activity. This may be qualitatively described as a transition from a shallow marine carbonate shoal with an epibenthic fauna (Tsagaankhaalga), to a deeper, clastic dominated environment with a nektic fauna (Govialtai). The pulse of tectonism must predate the lower Givetian, and it echoes the \"Tsakhir Event\", which is recorded by the transition from Ordovician-Silurian carbonates to Lochkovian conglomerate. These findings provide useful biostratigraphic control and insight into the complex tectonic evolution of the Gobi-Altai Terrane and adjacent blocks on the Eurasian Craton. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

    schema:about "Smallholder agricultural carbon market projects have potential to achieve climate-smart agriculture (CSA), a \"triple-win\" for food security, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. Farmer participation is critical for achieving widespread impact, yet their adoption of sustainable land management practices is constrained by eligibility, willingness, and ability to participate. This research examines how the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project enabled smallholder participation, with results emphasizing the importance of institutional conditions and farmers' perceptions. Findings highlight the necessity of international collaborations and high levels of synergistic coordination. Building social capital and adopting participatory learning approaches are strategies that can increase participation and create inclusive climate-smart agriculture projects.

    schema:about "A total of 223 samples from the general population of Ladakh in Northwestern India were amplified at 17 Y-STR loci using the AmpF l STRÂ® Yfilerâ„¢ system. The DNA profiles generated were employed to generate allelic frequencies, gene diversity, haplotype diversity and discrimination capacity values as well as number of different haplotypes, fraction of unique haplotypes and Rst pair wise genetic distances. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Correspondence Analysis (CA) were performed with the Rst values and allelic frequencies, respectively. The 17-loci discrimination capacity of Ladakh was found to be 0.8093. Eleven out of the 16 loci have diversity values greater than 0.6, and 13 loci possess values greater than 0.5. Ladakh exhibits no significant genetic difference to seven of the 15 reference forensic databases after Bonferroni correction, three of which are located in South Central Asian and four are from the Himalayan region. Rst genetic distance values before and after Bonferroni corrections illustrate the capacity of the Yfiler system to discriminate among Himalayan populations. The intermediate position of the Ladakh population in the MDS and CA plots likely reflects genetic flow and admixture with neighboring populations. In addition, the longitudinal partition of populations in the MDS and CA plots likely reflect human dispersals such as the silk road migrations.

    schema:about "In Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica, the Fosdick Mountains migmatite-cored gneiss dome was exhumed from mid- to lower middle crustal depths during the incipient stage of the West Antarctic Rift system in the mid-Cretaceous. Prior to and during exhumation, major crustal melting and deformation induded transfer and emplacement of voluminous granitic material and numerous intrusions of mantle-derived diorite in dikes. A succession of melt- and magma-related structures formed at temperatures in excess of 665 +/- 50 degrees C based on Ti-in-zircon thermometry. These record a transition from wrench to oblique extensional deformation that culminated in the development of the oblique South Fosdick Detachment zone. Solid-state fabrics within the detachment zone and overprinting brittle structures record translation of the detachment zone and dome to shallow levels. To determine the duration of exhumation and cooling, we sampled granite and gneisses at high spatial resolution for U-Pb zircon geochronology and Ar-40/Ar-39 hornblende and biotite thermochronology. U-Pb zircon crystallization ages for the youngest granites are 102 Ma. Three hornblende ages are 103 to 100 Ma and 12 biotite ages are 101 to 99 Ma. All overlap within uncertainty. The coincidence of zircon crystallization ages with Ar-40/Ar-39 cooling ages indicates cooling rates >100 degrees C/m.y. that, when considered together with overprinting structures, indicates rapid exhumation of granite and migmatite from deep to shallow crustal levels within a transcurrent setting. Orientations of structures and age-constrained crosscutting relationships indicate counterclockwise rotation of stretching axes from oblique extension into nearly orthogonal extension with respect to the Marie Byrd Land margin. The rotation may be a result of localized extension arising from unroofing and arching of the Fosdick dome, extensional opening within a pull-apart zone, or changes in plate boundary configuration. The rapid tectonic and temperature evolution of the Fosdick Mountains dome lends support to recently developed numerical models of crustal flow and cooling in orogenic crust undergoing extension/transtension, and accords with numerous studies of migmatite-cored gneiss domes in transcurrent settings.

    schema:about "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous, bioaccumulative flame retardants. Much remains to be learned about their developmental toxicological properties, particularly with regards to chronic exposure. In two experiments, male Long-Evans rats ingested the commercial pentaBDE mixture DE-71 from birth onward, first through the milk of lactating dams (who ingested 5 or 7.5 mg DE-71/day in a custom-mixed chow), then directly via chow consumption (at a dose of 3 or 4.5 mg/day). Control rats consumed the same brand of chow without DE-71. As adults, the rats were assessed for learning and attention using a series of five-choice serial reaction time tasks. A challenge with the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (0, 0.01, 0.03, or 0.05 mg/kg injected s.c.) was conducted on the final attention task. Serum total thyroxine (T4) levels were obtained at the end of testing. Total T4 was significantly lower in both DE-71 groups than in controls. Visual discrimination learning was unaffected by DE-71, but rats ingesting 4.5 mg/day DE-71 demonstrated significant impairments in sustained attention and inhibitory control, as evidenced by increased premature responding and decreased accuracy of responding in Attention Task 1. However, the DE-71-exposed rats did not respond differentially to the effects of scopolamine on attention compared to controls. These effects of chronic developmental DE-71 exposure differ from effects seen with brief postnatal exposure, suggesting that more research needs to be done on the more environmentally relevant chronic exposure model.

    schema:about "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), flame retardant chemicals added to polymer products, have become ubiquitous in the environment, and they are bioaccumulating in humans and wildlife. Therefore, understanding their biological effects is important for public health. We have previously observed learning deficits in rats exposed to DE-71, a commercial PBDE mixture consisting primarily of pentabrominated diphenyl ethers, at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day from postnatal day (PND) 6 to 12. The purpose of the current study was to determine if this effect could be seen with lower doses of DE-71. Long-Evans rats were administered daily oral doses of corn oil alone or DE-71, 5 or 15 mg/kg/day, dissolved in corn oil, from PND 6 to 12. As young adults, the rats were administered a series of five-choice visual learning and attention tasks. No effects of DE-71 were found on learning, attention, or inhibitory control. Given that developmental DE-71 exposure at similar doses and for shorter time periods has been shown in other laboratories to affect locomotion and hyperactivity, the current results suggest that cognitive functions may not be as sensitive as neuromotor functions to the effects of acute DE-71 exposure.

    schema:about "In designing screens to assess potential neurotoxicants, the paramount goal is that the selected assessment tools detect dysfunction if it exists. This goal is particularly challenging in the case of cognitive assessments. Cognition is not a unitary phenomenon, and indeed there is growing evidence that different aspects of cognitive functioning are subserved by distinct neural systems. As a result, if a particular neurotoxicant selectively damages certain neural systems but not others, it can impair some cognitive, sensory, or affective functions, but leave many others intact. Accordingly, studies with human subjects use batteries of cognitive tests, cognizant of the fact that no one test is capable of detecting all forms of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, assessment of cognitive functioning in non-human animal developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) studies typically consists of a single, presumably representative, \"learning and memory\" task that is expected to detect all potential effects on cognitive functioning. Streamlining the cognitive assessment in these studies saves time and money, but these shortcuts can have serious consequences if the aspect of cognitive functioning that is impaired is not tapped by the single selected task. In particular, executive functioning - a constellation of cognitive functions which enables the organism to focus on multiple streams of information simultaneously, and revise plans as necessary - is poorly assessed in most animal DNT studies. The failure to adequately assess these functions - which include attention, working memory, inhibitory control, and planning - is particularly worrisome in light of evidence that the neural systems that subserve these functions may be uniquely vulnerable to early developmental insults. We illustrate the importance of tapping these areas of functioning in DNT studies by describing the pattern of effects produced by early developmental Pb exposure. Rats exposed to lead (Pb) early in development were tested on a series of automated attention tasks, as well as on a radial arm maze task. The lead-exposed rats were not impaired in this demanding radial arm maze task, despite conditions which tapped the limits of both working and long-term memory. In contrast, the automated tests designed to assess rodent executive functioning revealed selective and functionally important deficits in attention and regulation of emotion or negative affect (produced by committing an error or not receiving an expected reward). This example underscores the importance of including tasks to specifically tap executive functioning in DNT batteries. Such tasks are not only sensitive but can also shed light on the specific nature of the dysfunction, and they can implicate dysfunction of specific neural systems, information which can be used to design therapeutic interventions. Although the use of such tasks increases the time and effort needed to complete the battery, the benefits outweigh the cost, in light of the greater sensitivity of the battery and the more complete characterization of effects.

    schema:about "This article discusses the comments made by Golub, Herr, and Sobin on the Special Issue of Neurotoxicology and Teratology. Decisions to include or not include these tests in a battery for a particular compound absolutely must be made in consultation with those who understand the intricacies of behavioral neuroscience in the model species. The author agrees with Herr's suggestion to regularize a negotiation process between regulatory authorities and sponsors to agree upon specific tests based on data from similar compounds or classes of compounds. Sobin emphasizes an important aspect of DNT testing that must not be neglected in the designing of testing batteries: a lifespan approach is vital for identifying in particular the delayed effects of early insults to the nervous system. In order to properly assess for changes across the lifespan, repeated tests of the same animals is ideal; and, as she mentions, tests of cognitive function that require extended training have poor temporal resolution. Indeed, 'no training' and 'minimal training' tests, such as those for various aspects of motor and sensory function, are by nature well-suited for multipletesting studies.

    schema:about "Five studies compare the effects of forming an independent judgment prior to receiving advice with the effects of receiving advice before forming one's own opinion. We call these the independent-then-revise sequence and the dependent sequence, respectively. We found that dependent participants adjusted away from advice, leading to fewer estimates close to the advice compared to independent-then-revise participants (Studies 1-5). This \"push-away\" effect was mediated by confidence in the advice (Study 2), with dependent participants more likely to evaluate advice unfavorably and to search for additional cues than independent-then-revise participants (Study 3). Study 4 tested accuracy under different advice sequences. Study 5 found that classic anchoring paradigms also show the push-away effect for median advice. Overall, the research shows that people adjust from representative (median) advice. The paper concludes by discussing when push-away effects occur in advice taking and anchoring studies and the value of independent distributions for observing these effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

    schema:about "Upper Devonian to Lower Mississippian strata in Utah and Montana record global events through this important interval in Earth history. Late Famennian strata of the Beirdneau, Leatham, and Pilot Shale formations in Utah, and Three Forks and Sappington formations in Montana, record widespread deposition of generally fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate strata. Integration of sedimentology, physical stratigraphy, chemostratigraphy, and published biostratigraphy allows for the recognition of important disconformities and regional stratigraphic patterns. These enable the reconstruction of uppermost Devonian to lowermost Mississippian depositional, tectonic, and eustatic history of the region. Carbon isotopic data allows for stratigraphic evaluation of the presence and absence of global bioevents of the Late Devonian, including the Annulata, Dasberg, and Hangenberg events, some of which are clearly recorded in hinterland deposits to the east in Colorado. While the Devonian-Mississippian boundary is also missing in our sections, a significant positive shift in delta C-13(carb) in Lower Mississippian strata in Utah and Montana represents one of the largest positive delta C-13(carb) isotope excursions of the Phanerozoic, linked to drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and glaciation in the Kinderhookian. Detrital zircon spectra from latest Devonian to Early Mississippian strata of Utah and Colorado include populations representing derivation from the Mazatzal and Yavapai provinces, Middle Proterozoic anorogenic granite bodies, and a small influx of Grenville and presumed Appalachian-Caledonian grains. Minor Paleoproterozoic and Late Archean peaks in Utah are likely multiple generation grains originally derived from the Peace River Arch of northwestern Canada and recycled in Ordovician rocks of Nevada. These patterns in detrital zircon geochronological data reflect, in part, changes in sediment dispersal patterns due to tectonic and eustastic variability-within the Antler foreland basin during the Devonian-Mississippian boundary interval. This variability also led to irregular spatial patterns of unconformity development, as well as complicated physical stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    schema:about "The Birmania inlier in western Rajasthan, India, contains important phosphate deposits, the depositional age of which is poorly constrained. Here we provide the first direct age constraints for the phosphate-bearing Birmania Formation using a combination of paleontological and detrital zircon U-Pb data. The occurrence of the multicellular algal fossil Wengania exquisita in phosphatic chert of the Birmania Formation suggest that it was deposited during the Ediacaran. Detrital zircon age distributions contain prominent populations of 1.7-1.9 Ga grains, with subordinate younger grains that range from 650 to 980 Ma. The distribution broadly resembles those from Neoproterozoic strata from both cratonic and Himalayan India but, like zircon age distributions from the Marwar Group, lacks 1.0-1.2 Ga grains, which may suggest that both areas shared similar local sources. The lack of zircon grains younger than 650 Ma is consistent with an Ediacaran depositional age because almost all Cambrian or younger strata from India have yielded Cambrian or latest Neoproterozoic age grains. These findings raise the possibility of a previously unrecognized late Neoproterozoic episode of phosphogenesis on the India craton. The presence of Wengania exquisita further supports strong palaeogeographic affinity between the India and South China during the Neoproterozoic and Cambrian. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design: A 2 (Male/Female) x 2 (Athlete Prime/No Athlete Prime) design was used to assess effort and performance on a math test. Method: A subtle threat manipulation was used to prime half of 60 NCAA Division III student-athletes with their athletic identity prior to taking a difficult math test. Results: Supporting the hypotheses, student-athletes who were primed with their athletic identity attempted significantly fewer problems and received lower mean math scores than those who were not primed. Contrary to hypotheses, gender did not impact effort or performance, and there was no evidence of buffering effects of priming non-athlete identities. Conclusions: The results of this experiment provide evidence for stereotype threat effects across genders and into Division III athletes, which potentially impact student-athlete academic performance.

    schema:about "High-resolution modern climate data for the Southern and Central Rocky Mountains provide a starting point for analysis of climate changes necessary to produce regional Late Pleistocene glaciation. A GIS-based model was used to assess the sensitivity of glaciation in different ranges to climatic change and the combinations of temperature and precipitation change necessary to sustain the last glacial maximum (LGM) extent of glaciation in each range. Extensive glaciation initiates first in the Wind River Range of Wyoming under every climate change scenario tested. In absence of precipitation change a summer temperature depression of 6-8 degrees C would be necessary to maintain LGM ice extents in Colorado and Wyoming. If precipitation was halved, necessary summer temperature depression would be 8-10 degrees C; if precipitation was doubled, a depression of 3.5-5.5 degrees C would suffice. Given model uncertainties, these values may underestimate necessary temperature depression by as much as 2 C. Under all scenarios tested, LGM glaciation in Utah, particularly the Wasatch Range, requires either more temperature depression for given precipitation change, or more precipitation for a given temperature depression than is required in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies. A summer temperature depression of 7 degrees C, which would suffice to sustain LGM ice extent with little change from modern precipitation in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies, would need to be coupled with a near doubling of precipitation to maintain LGM ice extent in the Wasatch Range. This difference appears to reflect LGM precipitation enhancement in the Wasatch Range, and to a lesser degree the Uinta Mountains, resulting from the presence of Lake Bonneville immediately upwind of these ranges.

    schema:about "Cosmogenic Be-10 surface-exposure dating and numerical glacier modeling are used to reconstruct glacial chronology and climate in the Colorado Sangre de Cristo Mountains during the local last glacial maximum (LLGM) and the subsequent deglaciation. Twenty-two surface-exposure ages on moraine boulders and polished-bedrock outcrops in the Willow Creek valley and ten in two adjacent valleys indicate that glaciers were at or near their maxima from similar to 21 ka until 17-16 ka, and then retreated rapidly, nearly deglaciating the Willow Creek valley entirely by similar to 14 ka. Coupled energy/mass-balance and flow modeling of two of the glaciers indicates that, if changing ice extent was driven only by temperature and insolation changes, temperature depressions of 5.0 and 5.1 degrees C from modern conditions, with an uncertainty of approximately +1.5/ 1.0 degrees C, would have sustained the glaciers in mass-balance equilibrium at their LLGM extents. Doubling or halving of modern precipitation during the LLGM would have been associated with 2.7-3.0 degrees C and 6.9-7.0 degrees C temperature depression respectively. Approximately half of the subsequent LLGM to-modern climate change was accomplished by similar to 14 ka. If the rapid main phase of deglaciation between about 16 ka and 14 ka was driven solely by temperature and insolation changes, it would have been associated with a temperature rise of about 2.5 degrees C, at a mean rate of approximately 1.1 degrees C/ky. This new chronology of the last glaciation is generally consistent with others developed recently in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The numerical modeling, however, suggests a lesser LLGM temperature depression from modern conditions than have most previous studies in Colorado. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "Abstract: Quantifying the local and regional impacts of speciated mercury (Hg) emissions from major urban and industrial areas is critical for understanding Hg transport and cycling in the environment. The Chicago/Gary urban area is one location where Hg emissions from industrial sources are significant and the regional transport of emissions may contribute to elevated ambient Hg concentrations at downwind locations. From July to November 2007, we collected semi-continuous measurements of gaseous elemental Hg (Hg0), fine particulate bound Hg (Hgp), and divalent reactive gaseous Hg (RGM) in Chicago, IL and Holland, MI to characterize the impact of Chicago/Gary source emissions on Hg concentrations in southwest Michigan and to improve our overall understanding of speciated Hg transport and deposition. The mean (and median) concentrations of Hg0, Hgp, and RGM in Chicago were 2.5ng/m3 (1.9ng/m3), 9pg/m3 (5pg/m3), and 17pg/m3 (6pg/m3), respectively. In Holland the mean (and median) concentrations were 1.3ng/m3 (1.3ng/m3), 6pg/m3 (6pg/m3), and 8pg/m3 (2pg/m3), respectively. Cluster analysis of 24-hour HYSPLIT back-trajectories associated with the semi-continuous Hg measurements indicated that southwest transport from Chicago/Gary to Holland occurred during approximately 27% of the study. In Holland, under this transport regime, we observed a five-fold increase in RGM relative to the median concentration of the other transport clusters. We applied the HYSPLIT dispersion model to two case study periods to further quantify the impact of Chicago/Gary sources on southeast Michigan and investigate the role of direct transport and dispersion of speciated Hg emissions. Results suggested that more than 50% of the maximum RGM concentrations observed in Holland during the selected periods could be attributed to direct transport of primary RGM emissions from Chicago/Gary. The remaining RGM fractions are believed to be associated with Hg0 oxidation during transport over Lake Michigan.

    schema:about "Abstract: From August 4, 2007 to August 31, 2009, we collected event-based precipitation samples for mercury (Hg) and trace element analyses at four sites in Illinois (IL), USA. The objectives of these measurements were to quantify Hg wet deposition across the state, and to assess the contributions to Hg in precipitation from major local and regional emission sources. Monitoring sites were located, from north to south, in Chicago, Peoria, Nilwood, and Carbondale, IL. Measurements from these four sites demonstrated that a clear spatial gradient in Hg wet deposition was not evident across the state. Each site received>10?gm-2 of Hg wet deposition annually, and these observed values were comparable to annual Hg wet deposition measurements from other event-based precipitation monitoring sites in source-impacted areas of the Midwestern U.S. We applied the multivariate statistical receptor model, Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA PMF v3.0), to the measured Hg and trace element wet deposition amounts at the four sites. Results suggested that 50% to 74% of total Hg wet deposition at each site could be attributed to coal combustion emissions. The other source signatures identified in the precipitation compositions included cement manufacturing, mixed metal smelting/waste incineration, iron?steel production, and a phosphorus source. We also applied a hybrid receptor model, Quantitative Transport Bias Analysis (QTBA), to the Hg wet deposition datasets to identify the major source regions associated with the measured values. The calculated QTBA probability fields suggested that transport from urban/industrial areas, such as Chicago/Gary, St. Louis, and the Ohio River Valley, resulted in some of the highest estimated event-based Hg wet deposition amounts at the four sites (potential mass transfer of up to 0.32?gm-2). The combined application of PMF and QTBA supported the hypothesis that local and regional coal combustion was the largest source of Hg wet deposition in Illinois.

    schema:about "The anthropogenic emission and subsequent deposition of heavy metals including mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) present human health and environmental concerns. Although it is known that local and regional sources of these metals contribute to deposition in the Great Lakes region, it is difficult to trace emissions from point sources to impacted sites. Recent studies suggest that metal isotope ratios may be useful for distinguishing between and tracing source emissions. We measured Pb, strontium (Sr), and Hg isotope ratios in daily precipitation samples that were collected at seven sites across the Great Lakes region between 2003 and 2007. Lead isotope ratios ( 207 Pb/ 206 Pb = 0.8062 to 0.8554) suggest that Pb deposition was influenced by coal combustion and processing of Mississippi Valley-Type Pb ore deposits. Regional differences in Sr isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.70859 to 0.71155) are likely related to coal fly ash and soil dust. Mercury isotope ratios (d 202 Hg = - 1.13 to 0.13?) also varied among the sites, likely due to regional differences in coal isotopic composition, and fractionation occurring within industrial facilities and in the atmosphere. These data represent the first combined characterization of Pb, Sr, and Hg isotope ratios in precipitation collected across the Great Lakes region. We demonstrate the utility of multiple metal isotope ratios in parallel with traditional trace element multivariate statistical modeling to enable more complete pollution source attribution.

The effects of abortion restrictions for minors are largest and the most significant for women aged 18 and younger, and the effect of these restrictions decrease in magnitude and significance gradually as women age. As the percent of the state's women without a provider increases, abortions are more difficult to obtain, and women are more likely to use the pill. When a larger percentage of women have a provider, abortions are more easily obtained, and there is a negative effect on pill usage. These results indicate that young women are forward thinking when making their contraceptive decisions, relative to the direct and indirect restrictions on abortion access.

Research on pharmaceutical prices rarely accounts for the impact of liability risk, and none that we are aware of compares the United States and United Kingdom. Drawing on a dataset of 77 brand name drugs sold in both the U.S. and the U.K., we analyze relative manufacturers' factory prices in each nation. We utilize several proxies for liability risk including drug litigation history, the percentage of plaintiff wins, and controlled substance classification. Importantly, under U.S. law there are no caps on the amount that can be awarded to a plaintiff claiming economic losses in the U.S. However, payouts in the U.K. are limited. Accounting for market differences and regulatory environments, we find liability risk can account for a portion of the price differential that exists between the U.S. and U.K., warranting further investigation.

    schema:about "We present an integrative model predicting associations among epiphytism, the tank habit, entangling seeds, C-3 vs. CAM photosynthesis, avian pollinators, life in fertile, moist montane habitats, and net rates of species diversification in the monocot family Bromeliaceae. We test these predictions by relating evolutionary shifts in form, physiology, and ecology to time and ancestral distributions, quantifying patterns of correlated and contingent evolution among pairs of traits and analyzing the apparent impact of individual traits on rates of net species diversification and geographic expansion beyond the ancestral Guayana Shield. All predicted patterns of correlated evolution were significant, and the temporal and spatial associations of phenotypic shifts with orogenies generally accorded with predictions. Net rates of species diversification were most closely coupled to life in fertile, moist, geographically extensive cordilleras, with additional significant ties to epiphytism, avian pollination, and the tank habit. The highest rates of net diversification were seen in the bromelioid tank-epiphytic clade (D-crown = 1.05 My(-1)), associated primarily with the Serra do Mar and nearby ranges of coastal Brazil, and in the core tillandsioids (D-crown = 0.67 My(-1)), associated primarily with the Andes and Central America. Six large-scale adaptive radiations and accompanying pulses of speciation account for 86% of total species richness in the family. This study is among the first to test a priori hypotheses about the relationships among phylogeny, phenotypic evolution, geographic spread, and net species diversification, and to argue for causality to flow from functional diversity to spatial expansion to species diversity.

    schema:about "Though considerable progress has been made in inferring phylogenetic relationships of many plant lineages, deep unresolved nodes remain a common problem that can impact downstream efforts, including taxonomic decision-making and character reconstruction. The Core Goodeniaceae is a group affected by this issue: data from the plastid regions trnL-trnF and matK have been insufficient to generate adequate support at key nodes along the backbone of the phylogeny. We performed genome skimming for 24 taxa representing major clades within Core Goodeniaceae. The plastome coding regions (CDS) and nuclear ribosomal repeats (NRR) were assembled and complemented with additional accessions sequenced for nuclear G3PDH and plastid trnL-trnF and matk. The CDS, NRR, and G3PDH alignments were analyzed independently and topology tests were used to detect the alignments' ability to reject alternative topologies. The CDS, NRR, and G3PDH alignments independently supported a Brunonia (Scaevola s.l. (Coopernookia (Goodenia s.l.))) backbone topology, but within Goodenia s.l., the strongly-supported plastome topology (Goodenia A (Goodenia B (Velleia + Goodenia C))) contrasts with the poorly supported nuclear topology ((Goodenia A + Goodenia B) (Velleia + Goodenia C)). A fully resolved and maximally supported topology for Core Goodeniaceae was recovered from the plastome CDS, and there is excellent support for most of the major clades and relationships among them in all alignments. The composition of these seven major clades renders many of the current taxonomic divisions non-monophyletic, prompting us to suggest that Goodenia may be split into several segregate genera.

    schema:about "Well-preserved moraines from the penultimate, or Bull Lake, glaciation of Snowmass Creek Valley in the Elk Range of Colorado (USA) present an opportunity to examine the character of the high-altitude climate in the Rocky Mountains during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 6. This study employs a 2-D coupled mass/energy balance and flow model to assess the magnitudes of temperature and precipitation change that could have sustained the glacier in mass-balance equilibrium at its maximum extent during the Bull Lake glaciation. Variable substrate effects on glacier flow and ice thickness make the modeling somewhat more complex than in geologically simpler settings. Model results indicate that a temperature depression of about 6.7 degrees C compared with the present (1971-2000 AD) would have been necessary to sustain the Snowmass Creek glacier in mass-balance equilibrium during the Bull Lake glaciation, assuming no change in precipitation amount or seasonality. A 50% increase or decrease from modern precipitation would have been coupled with 5.2 degrees C and 9.1 degrees C Bull Lake temperature depressions respectively. Uncertainty in these modeled temperature depressions is about 1 degrees C. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved." ;

    schema:about "In North America, terrestrial records of biodiversity and climate change that span Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 are rare. Where found, they provide insight into how the coupling of the ocean-atmosphere system is manifested in biotic and environmental records and how the biosphere responds to climate change. In 2010-2011, construction at Ziegler Reservoir near Snowmass Village, Colorado (USA) revealed a nearly continuous, lacustrine/wetland sedimentary sequence that preserved evidence of past plant communities between similar to 140 and 55 lea, including all of MIS 5. At an elevation of 2705 m, the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site also contained thousands of well-preserved bones of late Pleistocene megafauna, including mastodons, mammoths, ground sloths, horses, camels, deer, bison, black bear, coyotes, and bighorn sheep. In addition, the site contained more than 26,000 bones from at least 30 species of small animals including salamanders, otters, muskrats, minks, rabbits, beavers, frogs, lizards, snakes, fish, and birds. The combination of macro- and micro-vertebrates, invertebrates, terrestrial and aquatic plant macrofossils, a detailed pollen record, and a robust, directly dated stratigraphic framework shows that high-elevation ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado are climatically sensitive and varied dramatically throughout MIS 5.

    schema:about "In the last years of the eighteenth century, Egypt famously witnessed the practice of European sciences as embodied in the members of Bonaparte's Commission des sciences et des arts and the newly founded Institut d'Egypte. Less well known are the activities of local eighteenth-century Cairene religious scholars and military elites who were both patrons and practitioners of scientific expertise and producers of hundreds upon hundreds of manuscripts. Through the writings of the French naturalist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1844) and those of the Cairene scholar and chronicler (c)Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti (1753-1825), I explore Egypt as a site for the practice of the sciences in the late eighteenth century, the palatial urban houses which the French made home to the Institut d'Egypte and their role before the French invasion, and the conception of the relationship between the sciences and social politics that each man sought. Ultimately, I argue that Geoffroy's struggle to create scientific neutrality in the midst of intensely tumultuous political realities came to a surprising head with his fixation on Paris as the site for the practice of natural history, while al-Jabarti's embrace of this entanglement of knowledge and power led to a vision of scientific expertise that was specifically located in his Cairene society, but which - as Geoffroy himself demonstrated - could be readily adapted almost anywhere." ;

To do so, we propose independent effects of policy diffusion and the percentage of females in a state legislature. Building on this framework, we then suggest a process of gendered diffusion, whereby female state legislators represent a unique diffusion network for \"women's interest\" issues both within their own legislature, as well as across state networks. Taken together, this paper suggests that, for certain types of new issue areas, the demographic composition of state legislative chambers and the policy diffusion process are conditional on one another. This finding extends the bodies of scholarship concerning descriptive representation and policy diffusion, and presents a novel way to look at the policy-making process." ;

    schema:about "People often assume that everyone can be divided by sex/gender (that is, by physical and social characteristics having to do with maleness and femaleness) into two tidy categories: male and female. Careful thought, however, leads us to reject that simple 'binary' picture, since not all people fall precisely into one group or the other. But if we do not think of sex/gender in terms of those two categories, how else might we think of it? Here I consider four distinct models; each model correctly captures some features of sex/gender, and so each is appropriate in some contexts. But the first three models are inadequate when tough questions arise, like whether trans women should be admitted as students at a women's college or when it is appropriate for intersex athletes to compete in women's athletic events. ('Trans' refers to the wide range of people who have an atypical gender identity for someone of their birth-assigned sex, and 'intersex' refers to people whose bodies naturally develop with markedly different physical sex characteristics than are paradigmatic of either men or women.) Such questions of inclusion and exclusion matter enormously to the people whose lives are affected by them, but ordinary notions of sex/gender offer few answers. The fourth model I describe is especially designed to make those hard decisions easier by providing a process to clarify what matters.

    schema:about "Cambrian biostratigraphy of the Indian subcontinent is best documented from the Parahio Formation of the Tethyan Himalaya. Recently established trilobite biostratigraphy shows that the formation encompasses the latest part of unnamed Stage 4 and much of unnamed Stage 5. A variety of small shelly fossils have been recovered via acid digestion of carbonate beds and include tetract and pentact hexactinellid sponge spicules, chancelloriid spicules belonging to Chancelloria sp. and a new species, Archiasterella dhiraji, shells of an helcionelloid comparable to Igorella maidipingensis, a meraspid ptychopariid trilobite, the tubular Cupitheca sp., a poorly preserved hyolith, and an assortment of spinose microfossils of uncertain affinity. These newly recovered microfossils are consistent with the trilobite-based lower and middle Cambrian age determination and do not support a late Cambrian age for the top of the Parahio Formation advocated in some recent literature. The microfossils reported herein significantly expand the known diversity of such fossils from Cambrian strata in the Himalayan region, and allow for comparison of this fauna with others from Gondwanaland and elsewhere. Integration with trilobite data indicate that the stratigraphic ranges of many small shelly fossils described in this study are greater than previously recognized." ;

    schema:about "The electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) deposition of crystalline germanium (Ge) in a eutectic mixture of liquid gallium (Ga) and indium (In) was analyzed as a function of liquid metal thickness, process temperature, and flux. Through control of reaction parameters, conditions were identified that allow selective nucleation and growth of crystalline Ge at the interface between e-GaIn and a crystalline Si substrate. The crystal growth rates of Ge by ec-LLS as a function of process temperatures were obtained from time-dependent powder X-ray diffraction measurements of crystalline Ge. The driving force, ?µ, for crystal formation in ec-LLS was estimated through analyses of the experimental data in conjunction with predictions from a finite-difference model. The required ?µ for Ge nucleation was tantamount to a supersaturation approximately 10² larger than the equilibrium concentration of Ge in e-GaIn at the investigated temperatures. These points are discussed both in the context of advancing new, low-temperature synthetic methodologies for crystalline semiconductor films and on understanding semiconductor crystal growth more deeply.

    schema:about "We use measurements made onboard the National Science Foundation's C-130 research aircraft during the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) experiment to examine total Hg (THg) emission ratios (EmRs) for six coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in the southeastern U.S. We compare observed enhancement ratios (ERs) with EmRs calculated using Hg emissions data from two inventories: the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). For four CFPPs, our measured ERs are strongly correlated with EmRs based on the 2011 NEI (rÂ² = 0.97), although the inventory data exhibit a -39% low bias. Our measurements agree best (to within Â±32%) with the NEI Hg data when the latter were derived from on-site emissions measurements. Conversely, the NEI underestimates by approximately 1 order of magnitude the ERs we measured for one previously untested CFPP. Measured ERs are uncorrelated with values based on the 2013 TRI, which also tends to be biased low. Our results suggest that the Hg inventories can be improved by targeting CFPPs for which the NEI- and TRI-based EmRs have significant disagreements. We recommend that future versions of the Hg inventories should provide greater traceability and uncertainty estimates.

    schema:about "The kynurenine pathway is responsible for the metabolism of more than 95% of dietary tryptophan (TRP) and produces numerous bioactive metabolites. Recent studies have focused on three enzymes in this pathway: indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO1), kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), and kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II). IDO1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, and these agents may also have therapeutic utility in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis. KMO inhibitors are being investigated as potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntingtons and Alzheimers diseases. KAT II inhibitors have been proposed in new therapeutic approaches toward psychiatric and cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Numerous medicinal chemistry studies are currently aimed at the design of novel, potent, and selective inhibitors for each of these enzymes. The emerging opportunities and significant challenges associated with pharmacological modulation of these enzymes will be explored in this review." ;

    schema:about "The direct preparation of crystalline indium antimonide (InSb) by the electrodeposition of antimony (Sb) onto indium (In) working electrodes has been demonstrated. When Sb is electrodeposited from dilute aqueous electrolytes containing dissolved Sb2O3, an alloying reaction is possible between Sb and In if any surface oxide films are first thoroughly removed from the electrode. The presented Raman spectra detail the interplay between the formation of crystalline InSb and the accumulation of Sb as either amorphous or crystalline aggregates on the electrode surface as a function of time, temperature, potential, and electrolyte composition. Electron and optical microscopies confirm that under a range of conditions, the preparation of a uniform and phase-pure InSb film is possible. The cumulative results highlight this methodology as a simple yet potent strategy for the synthesis of intermetallic compounds of interest.

    schema:about "Atmospheric deposition is a primary pathway by which mercury (Hg) enters terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; however, the chemical and meteorological processes that Hg undergoes from emission to deposition are not well understood. Hg stable isotope geochemistry is a growing field used to better understand Hg biogeochemical cycling. To examine the atmospheric Hg isotopic composition in the Great Lakes, precipitation and ambient vapor-phase Hg samples were collected in Chicago, IL, Holland, MI, and Dexter, MI, between April 2007 and September 2009. Precipitation samples were characterized by negative mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) (d202Hg=-0.79‰ to 0.18‰), while most vapor-phase samples displayed positive MDF (d202Hg=-0.59‰ to 0.43‰). Positive mass-independent fractionation (MIF) (?199Hg=0.04‰ to 0.52‰) was observed in precipitation, whereas MIF was slightly negative in vapor-phase samples (?199Hg=-0.21‰ to 0.06‰). Significant positive MIF of 200Hg up to 0.25‰ was also measured in precipitation. Such MIF of an even-mass Hg isotope has not been previously reported in natural samples. These results contrast with recent predictions of the isotopic composition of atmospheric Hg and suggest that, in addition to aqueous photoreduction, other atmospheric redox reactions and source-related processes may contribute to isotopic fractionation of atmospheric Hg.

    schema:about "Crystalline GaAs (c-GaAs) has been prepared directly through electroreduction of As2O3 dissolved in an alkaline aqueous solution at a liquid gallium (Ga(l)) electrode at modest temperatures (T = 80 ?C). Ga(l) pool electrodes yielded consistent electrochemical behavior, affording repetitive measurements that illustrated the interdependences of applied potential, concentration of dissolved As2O3, and electrodeposition temperature on the quality of the resultant c-GaAs(s). Raman spectra indicated the composition of the resultant film was strongly dependent on both the electrodeposition temperature and dissolved concentration of As2O3 but not to the applied bias. For electrodepositions performed either at room temperature or with high (=0.01 M) concentrations of dissolved As2O3, Raman spectra of the electrodeposited films were consistent with amorphous As(s). X-ray diffractograms of As(s) films collected after thermal annealing indicated metallurgical alloying occurred only at temperatures in excess of 200 C. Optical images and Raman spectra separately showed the composition of the as-electrodeposited film in dilute (=0.001 M) solutions of dissolved As2O3(aq) was pure c-GaAs(s) at much lower temperatures than 200 C. Diffractograms and transmission electron microscopy performed on as-prepared films confirmed the identity of c-GaAs(s). The collective results thus provide the first clear demonstration of an electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) process involving a liquid metal that serves simultaneously as an electrode, a solvent/medium for crystal growth, and a coreactant for the synthesis of a polycrystalline semiconductor. The presented data serve as impetus for the further development of the ec-LLS process as a controllable, simple, and direct route for technologically important optoelectronic materials such as c-GaAs(s).

    schema:about "Deposition of epitaxial germanium (Ge) thin films on silicon (Si) wafers has been achieved over large areas with aqueous feedstock solutions using electrochemical liquid phase epitaxy (ec-LPE) at low temperatures (T = 90 Â°C). The ec-LPE method uniquely blends the simplicity and control of traditional electrodeposition with the material quality of melt growth. A new electrochemical cell design based on the compression of a liquid metal electrode into a thin cavity that enables ec-LPE is described. The epitaxial nature, low strain character, and crystallographic defect content of the resultant solid Ge films were analyzed by electron backscatter diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, high resolution X-ray diffraction, and electron channeling contrast imaging. The results here show the first step toward a manufacturing infrastructure for traditional crystalline inorganic semiconductor epifilms that does not require high temperature, gaseous precursors, or complex apparatus.

    schema:about "This study compared performance of 15- to 17-month-old Ts65Dn mice to that of littermate controls on an automated sustained attention task in which the location, onset time, and duration of brief visual cues varied unpredictably. Ts65Dn mice committed more omission errors than controls, particularly on trials with the briefest cues. Videotape data revealed that the trisomic mice attended less than controls during the period before cue presentation and engaged in stereotypic jumping and grooming immediately after making an error. These findings reveal that Ts65Dn mice are impaired in sustaining attention and exhibit heightened reactivity to committing an error, and support the validity of this mouse model for studying Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.

    schema:about "Categorical perception (CP) refers to the influence of category knowledge on perception and is revealed by a superior ability to discriminate items across categories relative to items within a category. In recent years, the finding that CP is lateralized to the left hemisphere in adults has been interpreted as evidence for a kind of CP driven by language. The present research challenges this conclusion. In 2 experiments, we found that CP for novel object categories was stronger in the left hemisphere than in the right, consistent with a role for language. However, both labeled and unlabeled categories gave rise to such effects, and to comparable degrees. These results suggest that left-lateralized CP does not depend on language but rather may reflect the left hemisphere's more general propensity for categorical processing. Our findings raise implications for research on linguistic relativity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]" ;

    schema:about "The ability to upregulate cognitive control in motivationally salient situations was examined in individuals with schizophrenia (patients) and healthy controls. Fifty-four patients and 39 healthy controls were recruited. A computerized monetary response conflict task required participants to identity a picture, over which was printed a matching (congruent), neutral, or incongruent word. This baseline condition was followed by an incentive condition, in which participants were given the opportunity to win money on reward-cued trials. These reward-cued trials were interleaved with nonreward cued trials. Reaction times (RT) were examined for both incentive context effects (difference in RT between baseline and nonreward cue trials in the incentive condition) and incentive cue effects (difference in RT between nonreward and reward cue trials in the incentive condition). Compared with baseline, controls showed a speeding of responses during both the nonreward (incentive context effect) and reward cued (incentive cue effect) trials during the incentive condition, but with a larger incentive context than incentive cue effect, suggesting a reliance on proactive control strategies. Although patients also showed a speeding of responses to both nonreward and reward cued trials, they showed a significantly smaller incentive context effect than controls, suggesting a reduction in the use of proactive control and a greater reliance on the use of \"just-in-time,\" reactive control strategies. These results are discussed in light of the relationship between motivation and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia," ;

    schema:about "The placebo effect is any outcome that is not attributed to a specific treatment but rather to an individual's mindset (Benson & Friedman, 1996). This phenomenon can extend beyond its typical use in pharmaceutical drugs to involve aspects of everyday life, such as the effect of sleep on cognitive functioning. In 2 studies examining whether perceived sleep quality affects cognitive functioning, 164 participants reported their previous night's sleep quality. They were then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sleep quality conditions or 2 control conditions. Those in the \"above average\" sleep quality condition were informed that they had spent 28.7% of their total sleep time in REM, whereas those in the \"below average\" sleep quality condition were informed that they had only spent 16.2% of their time in REM sleep. Assigned sleep quality but not self-reported sleep quality significantly predicted participants' scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Controlled Oral Word Association Task. Assigned sleep quality did not predict participants' scores on the Digit Span task, as expected, nor did it predict scores on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which was unexpected. The control conditions showed that the findings were not due to demand characteristics from the experimental protocol. These findings supported the hypothesis that mindset can influence cognitive states in both positive and negative directions, suggesting a means of controlling one's health and cognition." ;

    schema:about "In the aftermath of the war in northern Uganda, former soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) face many challenges reintegrating into their communities. Former LRA soldiers often return home with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may exacerbate the social stigma of being in the LRA. Health professional and lay community members; (N = 119) attitudes toward former LRA soldiers with symptoms of PTSD were examined and compared with attitudes toward civilian victims with the same symptoms, both depicted in vignettes. It was hypothesized that there would be a greater negative bias toward former soldiers due to the dual stigma of involvement with the LRA and mental illness, particularly among lay participants who lacked education regarding the prognoses and treatment of the mentally ill. Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant difference in participants' attitudes toward the vignettes of LRA soldiers and civilian victims. Lay participants were less stigmatizing than health professionals and trainees on both measures of stigma: social distance and skill assessment. These findings suggest that the relationship between health education and stigma is complex in Uganda and different from what is found in most western research. Implications for research, treatment, and reintegration are discussed as Uganda moves forward. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "In our opinion Jonathan Lear is one of the most significant American thinkers in the first decades of the 21st Century. In his brilliant and seamless fusion of philosophy and psychoanalysis he has presented such a startlingly original concept of the human psyche and what is comprised in 'a distinctively human life' that it constitutes a novel and compelling human ontology. We present this ontology by attempting to unify Jonathan Lear's ideas from his first great psychoanalytic work, Love and its Place in Nature, through his most recent work on irony and psychic integrity. We explicate Lear's brilliant reformulation of Freud's theory of development, his critique of the Western attempt to overly organize the psyche to defend against psychic and social disruption, and his postmodern advocacy of 'living without a principle.' We conclude by showing how developing the virtues of courage and hope with a disposition to irony are the keys to becoming a person who can integrate the disparate parts of the psyche, engage in meaningful self-inquiry, and live in a vibrant openness to new possibilities. In sum, we attempt to show through Lear's work that it is only by living with both a psychoanalytic knowledge of the depths of the psyche and ways to access this depth that one can realize the possibilities of one's humanity to the fullest degree.

    schema:about "Approximately 8% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to come from land-use change(1), but this estimate excludes fluxes of terrestrial carbon to aquatic ecosystems from human disturbance. Carbon fluxes from land to rivers have probably increased by 0.1 to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year as a result of disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural intensification and the injection of human wastewater(2). Most dissolved organic carbon in rivers originates from young organic carbon from soils and vegetation(3), but aged carbon removed from the modern carbon cycle is also exported in many systems. Here we analyse a global data set of radiocarbon ages of riverine dissolved organic carbon and spatial data on land cover, population and environmental variables. We find that the age of dissolved organic carbon in rivers increases with population density and the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a watershed, and decreases with annual precipitation. We reason that disturbance reintroduces aged soil organic matter into the modern carbon cycle, although fossil carbon in fertilizer or petroleum products may also be a source of aged carbon in disturbed watersheds. The total export from the terrestrial environment to freshwater systems remains unknown; nevertheless, our results suggest that 3-9% of dissolved organic carbon in rivers is aged carbon mobilized by human disturbance." ;

In an effort to view Ladakh's multicultural history from a paternal genetic perspective, we performed a high-resolution Y-chromosomal survey of Ladakh, within the context of Y haplogroup and haplotype distributions of 41 Asian reference populations. The results of this investigation highlight the rich ethnic and genetic diversity of Ladkah which includes genetic contributions from disparate regions of the continent including, West, East, South and Central Asia. The phylogenetic signals from Ladakh are consistent with the Indo-Aryans' occupation during the Neolithic age and its historic connection with Tibet, as well as the East-West gene flow associated with the Silk Road." ;

In this study, for the first time, we attempt to alleviate this lacuna of knowledge by comprehensively investigating the Y chromosome composition of contemporary Mayan populations throughout their domain. To accomplish this, five geographically targeted and ethnically distinct Mayan populations are investigated using Y-SNP and Y-STR markers. Findings: overall, the Mayan populations as a group are highly homogeneous, basically made up of only two autochthonous haplogroups, Q1a2a1a1*-M3 and Q1a2a1*-L54. Although the Y-STR data illustrates diversity, this diversity, for the most part, is uniformly distributed among geographically distant Mayan populations. Similar haplotypes among populations, abundance of singletons and absence of population partitioning within networks among Mayan populations suggest recent population expansion and substantial gene flow within the Mayan dominion, possibly due to the development of agriculture, the establishment of interacting City-State systems and commerce." ;

    schema:about "A hallmark of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin, conserved from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, is its ability to spread to adjacent genomic regions(1-6). Central to heterochromatin spread is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin, oligomerizes and forms a versatile platform that participates in diverse nuclear functions, ranging from gene silencing to chromosome segregation(1-6). How HP1 proteins assemble on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome complex achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated nucleosomes drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a spreading-competent state. In the auto-inhibited state, a histonemimic sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks methyl-mark recognition by the chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition is relieved by recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends appear exposed. Disruption of the switch between the auto-inhibited and spreading-competent states disrupts heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing in vivo. These findings are reminiscent of other conditionally activated polymerization processes, such as actin nucleation, and open up a new class of regulatory mechanisms that operate on chromatin in vivo." ;

    schema:about "Williams syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by an uncommon hypersociability and a mosaic of retained and compromised linguistic and cognitive abilities. Nearly all clinically diagnosed individuals with Williams syndrome lack precisely the same set of genes, with breakpoints in chromosome band 7q11.23 (refs 1-5). The contribution of specific genes to the neuroanatomical and functional alterations, leading to behavioural pathologies in humans, remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate neural progenitor cells and cortical neurons derived from Williams syndrome and typically developing induced pluripotent stem cells. Neural progenitor cells in Williams syndrome have an increased doubling time and apoptosis compared with typically developing neural progenitor cells. Using an individual with atypical Williams syndrome(6,7), we narrowed this cellular phenotype to a single gene candidate, frizzled 9 (FZD9). At the neuronal stage, layer V/VI cortical neurons derived from Williams syndrome were characterized by longer total dendrites, increased numbers of spines and synapses, aberrant calcium oscillation and altered network connectivity. Morphometric alterations observed in neurons from Williams syndrome were validated after Golgi staining of postmortem layer V/VI cortical neurons. This model of human induced pluripotent stem cells(8) fills the current knowledge gap in the cellular biology of Williams syndrome and could lead to further insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the disorder and the human social brain." ;

    schema:about "T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual(1-4). Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCR beta chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands." ;

However, for short-lived mRNAs, the tight binding of the MS2 coat protein (MCP) to the MS2 binding sites (MBS) protects the RN A from being efficiently degraded, and this confounds the study of mRNA regulation. Here, we describe a reporter system (MBSV6) with reduced affinity for the MC P, which allows mRNA degradation while preserving single-molecule detection determined by single-molecule FISH (smFISH) or live imaging. Constitutive mRNAs (MDN1 and DOA1) and highly-regulated mRNAs (GAL1 and ASH1) endogenously tagged with MBSV6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae degrade normally. As a result, short-lived mRNAs were imaged throughout their complete life cycle. The MBSV6 reporter revealed that, in contrast to previous findings, coordinated recruitment of mRNAs at specialized structures such as P-bodies during stress did not occur, and mRNA degradation was heterogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm." ;

    schema:about "The debate concerning the origin of the Polynesian speaking peoples has been recently reinvigorated by genetic evidence for secondary migrations to western Polynesia from the New Guinea region during the 2nd millennium BP. Using genome-wide autosomal data from the Leeward Society Islands, the ancient cultural hub of eastern Polynesia, we find that the inhabitants' genomes also demonstrate evidence of this episode of admixture, dating to 1,700-1,200 BP. This supports a late settlement chronology for eastern Polynesia, commencing similar to 1,000 BP, after the internal differentiation of Polynesian society. More than 70% of the autosomal ancestry of Leeward Society Islanders derives from Island Southeast Asia with the lowland populations of the Philippines as the single largest potential source. These long-distance migrants into Polynesia experienced additional admixture with northern Melanesians prior to the secondary migrations of the 2nd millennium BP. Moreover, the genetic diversity of mtDNA and Y chromosome lineages in the Leeward Society Islands is consistent with linguistic evidence for settlement of eastern Polynesia proceeding from the central northern Polynesian outliers in the Solomon Islands. These results stress the complex demographic history of the Leeward Society Islands and challenge phylogenetic models of cultural evolution predicated on eastern Polynesia being settled from Samoa." ;

    schema:about "In several models of pathogenesis, Salmonella requires genes encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) for virulence. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium ), most SPI-1 genes are arranged in operons and are co-ordinately regulated in response to environmental signals via the SPI-1-encoded protein HilA. In order to understand how HilA controls the transcription of SPI-1 genes, we have analysed the invF and prgH promoters. We have reconstituted HilA-dependent activation of both promoters in Escherichia coli by supplying hilA on a plasmid, strongly suggesting that HilA acts directly on the promoters. By analysing the HilA-dependent activity of deletions and mutations in P invF , we identified cis elements necessary for HilA-dependent activation. Through biochemical studies, we have defined a probable HilA-binding sequence in the invF promoter. This ?HilA box? is intact in the minimal promoter identified through deletion analysis, and it is disrupted in one class of P invF mutants that has reduced activation by HilA. The prgH promoter also contains a HilA box in the same position relative to the +1 of transcription. This work is the first to connect HilA-dependent environmental regulation with a specific sequence in a SPI-1 virulence gene promoter.

    schema:about "Summary Salmonella typhimurium is a Gram-negative enteric pathogen that can infect intestinal epithelial cells and induce inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. These processes are mediated by a type III secretion system (TTSS), which is encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). Previous studies showed that four SPI1-encoded transcriptional regulators, HilD, HilC, HilA and InvF, act in an ordered fashion to co-ordinately activate expression of the SPI1 TTSS. HilD and HilC derepress hilA transcription. HilA activates invF as well as SPI1 genes that encode components of the TTS apparatus. InvF then activates genes that encode proteins secreted by the SPI1 TTS apparatus. In this scheme, HilD and HilC indirectly activate expression of the SPI1 TTS apparatus and its secreted substrates by affecting hilA expression. Here, we report that HilD and HilC can also activate expression of a subset of SPI1 genes independently of HilA. Our studies show that HilD and HilC activate transcription of invF from a promoter that is far upstream of its HilA-dependent promoter. This activation is most probably through direct binding of HilD and HilC to sequences upstream and downstream of this alternative HilA-independent promoter. We conclude that HilD and HilC have a second role in SPI1 gene regulation that is separate from their role in co-ordinating expression of the SPI1 TTSS through hilA .

    schema:about "After the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ended the Mexican American War in 1848, the United States-Mexico border became a site of intense smuggling. Increased smuggling along the South Texas-Mexico border also resulted in the increased policing and militarization of the border. The interrelated practices of militarization, policing and smuggling have become an integral part of an ever-evolving borderlands' existence as many Mexican Americans have sought the opportunity to make a lucrative income as drug smugglers and policing agents. The result is the division of Mexican American peer groups along the border into members of the 'criminal underworld' and the law enforcement agencies that police these criminals. This division has exacerbated tensions in border communities, and it has increasingly come to define the complexities and contradictions of life in the South Texas-Mexico borderlands during the 40-year tenure of the war on drugs. Despite the growing concern over the intensification of drug violence in the borderlands, there has been relatively little effort to critically analyze the social realities of the drug war along the US-Mexico border. In this article, I examine the impact of drug trafficking and drug war policing on a South Texas border community, by reflecting on the experiences of Mexican American drug traffickers, los mafiosos, and Mexican American law enforcement officers, la chota. As the social actors actively engaged in the drug war, the life histories of these drug traffickers and law enforcement officers reveal the detrimental effects of escalating border militarization, and also highlight the 'expendability' of Mexican Americans in the militarized Mexico-United States borderlands.

    schema:about "Increasing demands on nanometer-scale properties of oxide tunnel barriers necessitate a consistent means to assess them on these length scales. Conducting atomic force microscopy (CAFM) is a promising technique both for understanding connections between nanoscale tunnel barrier characteristics and macroscopic device performance as well as for rapid qualitative evaluation of new fabrication methods and materials. Here we report CAFM characterization of aluminum oxide (AlOx) barriers to be used in Josephson-junction qubits, with a particular emphasis on developing reproducible imaging conditions and appropriate interpretation. We find that control of the imaging force is a critical factor for reproducibility. We imaged the same sample on the same day with the same cantilever varying only the imaging force between scans. Statistical properties compiled from the resulting current maps varied approximately exponentially with imaging force, with typical currents increasing by two orders of magnitude for only a factor of 5 increase in imaging force. Given appropriate control of the imaging force, scan to scan variation of the current recorded at the same location was approximately +/-0.5, which establishes a criterion for statistical reproducibility of CAFM measurements. We further find that the appropriate interpretation for CAFM (under most imaging conditions), is as a probe of local propensity for insulator breakdown. Samples stored in air for weeks before study showed current features with oxidation times of order minutes. This indicates that these features were created by the scanning of the tip, and thus represent local pinhole susceptible regions. We finally present results for several AlOx samples showing that under appropriate imaging conditions significant sample to sample variation is observed, thus demonstrating the potential of this technique to qualitatively assess and facilitate under standing of potential qubit tunnel barrier devices.

    schema:about "This paper examines how rural communities in Colorado have confronted military expansion. Against the backdrop of a series of base realignments and closures during the past three decades that have streamlined US military holdings nationwide, the US Army base at Fort Carson, Colorado, has been growing. In 1983 Fort Carson expanded into a 95 500-hectare training area in southeastern Colorado known as the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS). In 2006 the Army announced plans to expand the PCMS by 169 000 hectares. Under the Army's proposal, a significant portion of southeastern Colorado would be transformed into the largest Army training ground in the US. This prospect galvanized a diverse coalition of rural residents to oppose the Pinon Canyon expansion. Our research critically considers how the principal actors in this case-the US Army and a rural citizen opposition coalition-mobilized different narrative and political strategies based substantially upon contrasting cartographic representations to shape the debate and construct contested geographies of this space as military training ground versus open range. As of 2014, the expansion of PCMS is on hold, although there is no guarantee that base or military area expansion will not proceed in the future." ;

    schema:about "Pericentromeric heterochromatin formation is mediated by repressive histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9Me) and its recognition by HP1 proteins. Intriguingly, in many organisms, RNAi is coupled to this process through poorly understood mechanisms. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the H3-K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) ortholog Swi6 are critical for RNAi, whereas RNAi stimulates H3K9Me. In addition to the endoribonuclease Dcr1, RNAi in S. pombe requires two interacting protein complexes, the RITS complex, which contains an Argonaute subunit, and the RDRC complex, which contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit. We previously identified Ers1 (essential for RNAi-dependent silencing) as an orphan protein that genetically acts in the RNAi pathway. Using recombinant proteins, we show here that Ers1 directly and specifically interacts with HP1/Swi6. Two-hybrid assays indicate that Ers1 also directly interacts with several RNAi factors. Consistent with these interactions, Ers1 associates in vivo with the RITS complex, the RDRC complex, and Dcr1, and it promotes interactions between these factors. Ers1, like Swi6, is also required for RNAi complexes to associate with pericentromeric noncoding RNAs. Overexpression of Ers1 results in a dominant-negative phenotype that can be specifically suppressed by increasing levels of the RDRC subunit Hrr1 or of Dcr1, further supporting a functional role for Ers1 in promoting the assembly of the RNAi machinery. Through the interactions described here, Ers1 may promote RNAi by tethering the corresponding enzyme complexes to HP1-coated chromatin, thereby placing them in proximity to the nascent noncoding RNA substrate." ;

    schema:about "It has always been difficult to account for the evolution of certain human characters such as language, empathy, and altruism via individual reproductive success. However, the striatum, a subcortical region originally thought to be exclusively motor, is now known to contribute to social behaviors and \"personality styles\" that may link such complexities with natural selection. We here report that the human striatum exhibits a unique neurochemical profile that differs dramatically from those of other primates. The human signature of elevated striatal dopamine, serotonin, and neuropeptide Y, coupled with lowered acetylcholine, systematically favors externally driven behavior and greatly amplifies sensitivity to social cues that promote social conformity, empathy, and altruism. We propose that selection induced an initial form of this profile in early hominids, which increased their affiliative behavior, and that this shift either preceded or accompanied the adoption of bipedality and elimination of the sectorial canine. We further hypothesize that these changes were critical for increased individual fitness and promoted the adoption of social monogamy, which progressively increased cooperation as well as a dependence on tradition-based cultural transmission. These eventually facilitated the acquisition of language by elevating the reproductive advantage afforded those most sensitive to social cues." ;

    schema:about "B cell lymphoma survival requires tonic or ligand-independent signals through activation of Syk by the B cell receptor. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein latent membrane 2a (LMP2a), a mimic of the B cell receptor, provides constitutive survival signals for latently infected cells through Syk activation; however, the precise downstream mechanisms coordinating this survival response in EBV+ B cell lymphomas remain to be elucidated. Herein, we assess the mechanism of Syk survival signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphomas from post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) to discover virally controlled therapeutic targets involved in lymphomagenesis and tumor progression. Using small molecule inhibition and siRNA strategies, we show that Syk inhibition reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of PTLD-derived EBV+ B cell lines. Syk inhibition also reduces autocrine IL-10 production. Although Syk inhibition attenuates signaling through both the PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways, only PI3K/Akt inhibition causes apoptosis of PTLD-derived cell lines. Loss of the endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP is observed after Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition. The loss of XIAP and apoptosis that results from Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition is reversed by inhibition of the mitochondrial protease HtrA2. Thus, Syk drives EBV+ B cell lymphoma survival through PI3K/Akt activation, which prevents the HtrA2-dependent loss of XIAP. Syk, Akt, and XIAP antagonists may present potential new therapeutic strategies for PTLD through targeting of EBV-driven survival signals.

    schema:about "Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a proven oncogene that is essential for transformation of human B cells by the virus. LMP1 induces constitutive activa- tion of several signal transduction pathways involving nuclear factor KB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and the mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAP K) p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Sequenc- ing of LMP1 isolated from a panel of EBVsup+] B cell lymphomas identified three different variants of LMP1, each distinct from the B95.8 prototype isoform. All tumor variants of LMP1 as well as the B95.8 LMP1 isoform were able to induce rapid p38 phos- phorylation as well as Akt and JNK activation. Additionally all variants showed similar ability to activate nuclear factor KB. In contrast, only tumor-derived LMP1 variants induced prolonged Erk activation and c-Fos expression. Sequence analysis revealed only two amino acids, 212 and 366, shared by the tumor variants but distinct from B95.8. Point mutation of either amino acids 212 (glycine to serine) or 366 (serine to threonine) from the B95.8 isoform to the tumor variant version of LMP1 was suffi- cient for gain of function characterized by sustained activation of Erk and subsequent c-Fos induction and binding to the APi site. Our results indicate that the enhanced ability of tumor- derived LMP1 to induce and stabilize the c-Fos oncogene can be localized to two amino acids in the C terminus of LMP1.

    schema:about "Financial regulators are challenged with finding the most efficient and effective ways to monitor banks given an expanding and complex international financial system. Market discipline has grown in importance as a way to discourage banks from taking on unnecessary risk. One of the main drivers of market discipline is information disclosure. While the literature on market discipline is expansive, there are no known studies on the impact of individual information disclosure requirements on market discipline. Our study investigates which specific disclosure requirements influence financial investors to discipline banks and which do not. We find that information disclosure requirements primarily reduce or have no impact on market discipline practices.

    schema:about "Students with disabilities continue to be denied literacy rich experiences with their non-disabled peers. Throughout this article the authors explore how narrow, ability-focused teacher dispositions can perpetuate low expectations and can preemptively deny students with disabilities access to meaningful literacy experiences. Hence, the development of an inclusive literacy disposition is crucial to providing access to robust learning experiences for students with disabilities. The authors describe a research study that utilizes journal writing and a role-play intervention with pre-service general educators in a graduate literacy methods course. Analysis of post-intervention data suggests it is possible to shift narrow, ability-orientated dispositions to broader and more inclusive conceptualizations that support students with disabilities. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

    schema:about "Based on fieldwork among the Makhuwa of northern Mozambique, this essay explores how non-Pentecostal models of transformation shape a people's manner of relating to Pentecostalism. Radical change has long been constitutive of Makhuwa history and subjectivity. Yet Makhuwa patterns of change, commonly conceived in terms of movement, entail regress as much as egress - circular mobilities that disrupt linear teleologies. State administrators and Pentecostal missionaries attempt to reform local inhabitants by, respectively, sedentarising' and converting' them. Deploying their historical proclivity towards mobility, those among whom I worked appear simultaneously eager to partake in resettlement schemes and reluctant to remain settled by them. I argue that their ambivalence towards Pentecostal churches and teachings, in particular, challenges two prevailing assumptions within anthropological studies of Christianity: that discontinuity is definitive, and that it is exceptional to Pentecostalism." ;

A nonzero current account provides a mechanism for intertemporal trade, and a country has a comparative advantage in present (or future) goods if its autarky real interest rate is below (or above) the world real interest rate. The authors explain why the intertemporal approach to the current account reaches different conclusions from the traditional approach regarding welfare effects. Also, the authors integrate alternative approaches for explaining the underlying cause(s) of nonzero current account balances." ;

In determining how to deal with the Keynesian/classical divide, instructors must decide whether to follow the modern approach of building macroeconomic relationships from micro foundations, or to use the traditional approach based on aggregate models of the macroeconomy. In this article, the authors discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each approach in the context of course objectives. Because there is significant heterogeneity in textbook coverage, the authors summarize some of the approaches taken in current intermediate-level textbooks, which should serve as a useful starting point for new instructors. The authors also discuss how each approach can be extended to analyze the recent recession in the United States." ;

Coaches allocated more opportunities to players for whom the false expectation was positive, and fewer shots to players for whom the false expectation was negative. In turn, players who were allocated more shots made a higher percentage of them, thereby confirming their coaches' expectations about their shooting ability, and were more confident in their shooting ability following the task, than players who were allocated fewer shots.

    schema:about "The dextral-reverse Alpine Fault offsets alluvial terraces of the Maruia River at Calf Paddock. RTK-GPS surveying of the faulted terraces yields detailed measurements of fault slip across terraces T1-T5. Pits were excavated to log the stratigraphy, date the deposits and to thereby constrain fault slip rates for this site. The mean of the four largest dextral offsets across terrace T2 is 12.0 +/- 1.3 m. The corresponding mean vertical offset is 1.6 +/- 0.6 m. A single charcoal date with an age of 1095-1275 cal yr BP is used to derive minimum dextral and reverse slip rates of 10 +/- 2 and 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm/yr, respectively. These rates are comparable with others observed nearby at Little and Lost Mary creeks and from previous studies at Calf Paddock. These new late Holocene slip rate estimates highlight the northeastward decrease in strike-slip and dip-slip rate along the northern section of the Alpine Fault as motion is partitioned onto faults of the Marlborough Fault System. The lack of aseismic creep observed across 'Evison's wall' highlights that slip is achieved at Calf Paddock during metre-scale coseismic displacements." ;

Yet, public audiences do not always receive research results in a passive and positive manner. Instead, as we discuss in this brief essay, research results can contested by multiple publics. At times, particularly in social media, the attacks can be swift. Research that is not intended to be a form of public sociology can inadvertently be brought into the public discourse. We discuss how interest groups, such as patient groups, can contest research results. Researchers can be personally attacked as well. These conflicts can create a turbulent environment where sociologists can lose control of their message. While most studies are released without incident, it is helpful to build the capacity of sociologists to participate in public sociology and manage challenges of their research results." ;

    schema:about "This article examines the production of China's \"ghost cities\" and constant urban expansion to challenge the dominant conceptual narrative of rural-to-urban migration as the driver of urbanisation. It argues that behind China's \"miraculous\" urbanisation story is a powerful ideological commitment to urban growth as the \"royal road\" to modernity and assessment of political performance. Local governments have a wide-ranging \"tool-kit\" for pursuing urbanisation, ranging from administrative border-drawing to expropriation of rural land and investment in expanding urban infrastructures. Urbanisation is the destination to which all paths seem to lead. Indeed, local states pursue the construction of new urban space, even when doing so harms them financially. But why? The concept of phantom urbanisation names the process whereby constructing the aesthetic form of the urban is even more important to local state actors than economic, demographic or environmental repercussions.

    schema:about "Drawing on a broad variety of field research projects among Salvadoran immigrant hometown associations in Los Angeles, conducted over a ten-year period, this paper seeks to contribute to the emerging literature on hometown associations by shifting the focus to the political processes underlying associational politics and the characteristics of the organizational field that structures their activities. We argue that conflict, both among migrants in the 'hostland' and between migrants in the hostland and stay-behinds in the 'homeland', is an inherent aspect of hometown association activities and their efforts to create sociability 'here' and development 'there'. We demonstrate that the hometowners abroad have difficulty deciding what they share in common; those who do engage in organized efforts to span here and there represent a select few. Moreover, the issue of how the migrants and their associations relate to the people and institutions left behind is often a dilemma, resolved in any number of ways, not all of which render satisfaction at either ends of the chain.

    schema:about "Academic librarians are challenged with development and maintenance of collections of research materials in various formats. Although it is assumed that they are monitoring the needs of their constituencies as a part of the collection management decision-making process, the literature reflects only a few studies that focus on direct solicitation of user opinions. This study included a 22-question survey sent to all faculty, staff, and graduate students in a cross-section of social science disciplines (anthropology, psychology, social work, and sociology) at one institution. Responses from 122 individuals (32.1% of faculty, 13.6% of graduate students, and 9.8% of staff) provide data about book and journal use that have informed collection development priorities and reveal shifting patterns of use in an increasingly hybrid (print and electronic) information environment. Results show that faculty and graduate students in all disciplines depend heavily on library collections and generally prefer to access materials online. When looking for books most respondents started from the library catalog, but those who indicated that the library was not important were more likely to search the Web and rely on colleagues to access materials, suggesting that social tagging might be an effective means of supporting resource discovery, especially if embedded in a scholarly community of practice. The relative importance of books and journals varies among (and within) disciplines and in accordance with the task at hand. Books are heavily used for teaching in all four disciplines, while journals are generally more important for research, especially among the more science-oriented specializations within anthropology and psychology. Even within these two disciplines, however, there are a number of scholars who rely heavily on books for research. Most respondents reported occasional use of interlibrary loan, more commonly for books than for journal articles, and this was generally considered to be an important and useful supplement to locally owned materials.

    schema:about "The article uses a self psychological lens to explore the notion of hysterical personality from our earliest understanding of it as the root of all psychogenic disorders, as discovered by Breuer and Freud, to its present elimination in the DSM-V. Can hysteria still be considered an applicable diagnosis or character style in the modern time? Or is it a culturally and historically limited phenomenon that no longer holds validity? Considering the case of Dora from Heinz Kohut's revolutionary view, which privileges the subjective and empathic stance in treatment, one can infer that Dora's own hysterical symptoms were not pathological, as Freud thought, but rather healthy attempts to bolster an enfeebled self. Nevertheless, both Kohut and his followers conclude that from a self psychological perspective both object-instinctual understandings, and self-object transferences, are essential for successful analytic treatment.

    schema:about "The article begins by analyzing the historical evolution of ?class ideology? in China, especially since 1978. Next, it turns to the concrete effects of the recent and ongoing recession on the Chinese working class. It finds that the crisis affected rural?urban migrants far more substantially than it did workers in the formal (mostly state-owned) urban sector. While this situation presents numerous challenges (for the central state, a crisis of legitimacy; for the local state, a crisis of managing social unrest as well as providing welfare; and, for the workers, a crisis of survival), it also creates opportunities for new conceptualizations and practices of class-politics. In conclusion, we discuss the nascent articulation of a few of these opportunities in labor-union activity, protests, and emergent rights-awareness, and legal consciousness among workers, as well as the implications for China's model of economic development.

    schema:about "Identifying suspect effort in neuropsychological assessments has been investigated in clinical samples and experimental simulation paradigms. While patients' incentives, such as compensation, are commonly thought to impact motivation, other motivational influences, such as attention-seeking, have been largely unexplored. To this end, undergraduates (n=202) were asked to fake a head injury on the Dot Counting Test, California Verbal Learning Test, and Benton Visual Retention Test. Participants were assigned to one of four Motivation conditions (no motivation, avoiding blame, compensation, attention-seeking). Analyses revealed that those with compensation- and attention-seeking motivations performed significantly worse than those with blame avoidance and no motivations, suggesting that type of motivation affects performance on neuropsychological assessment. The relative similarity between compensation-seekers and attention-seekers, however, suggests that the two groups would be difficult to differentiate. Preliminary findings suggest that compensation-seekers may favor errors of omission and attention-seekers may favor errors of commission in their performance; however this finding requires replication." ;

    schema:about "The questions of how to teach culture, which culture(s) to teach and how to lead students to intercultural competence and understanding are common questions for language teachers. The current project employed wikis to systematically integrate culture and authentic texts into beginning German courses at a large south-eastern university in the United States. The study examined whether close readings of authentic texts on a variety of cultural topics from German-speaking countries, careful discussion and then a final analysis of the topics in the form of students' essays could lead to a deeper understanding of the cultures of German-speaking countries and possibly of one's own culture. During this study, students were actively engaged in analysing authentic cultural documents to learn more about the products, practices and perspectives of the target culture, including how these three aspects interact and connect, thereby improving their analytical skills and thinking more critically about their own culture. As indicated by a pre-/post-test serving as quantitative data, students did increase their cultural knowledge of German-speaking countries, mainly in their knowledge of practices, over the semester. Qualitative analyses of their final essays indicated that students also expanded their awareness of perspectives of the target culture and gained a deeper understanding of their own culture.

    schema:about "Friedrich Holderlin's epistolary novel, Hyperion, opens with contradictory fantasies of the protagonist's unification with, and alienation from, nature. These visions of oneness and division find a corollary in the novel's setting within an idealized version of Greece and the landscape of the Corinthian Isthmus. The essay argues that we can best understand the significance of Hyperion's desire to be one with everything if we take into account the context of Holderlin's and Friedrich Schelling's attempt in the 1790s to find a way to incorporate a dynamic view of nature into German Idealist philosophy. Taking up the philosophical concept of intellectual intuition (used in distinctive ways by both Kant and Fichte before them) the young poet/philosophers attempted to grant a new range of meaning to the term. For them an intellectual form of intuition opens possibilities of non-material connections with a world of things that must themselves be viewed as dynamically alive. Reading the novel Hyperion as an attempt to poeticize this version of Idealism also allows us to see how the novel functions as a move from intellectual to aesthetic intuition, as an attempt to represent the human capacity for aesthetic creativity as our means of becoming one." ;

    schema:about "Communicators try to shape public opinion to their advantage by invoking social values. We examine a vivid example of this value framing in the debate over teaching evolution in the public schools. Supporters of intelligent design (ID) theory have pressed for greater acceptance in public schools by framing the issue as a question of fairness. A survey experiment revealed overwhelming agreement that including ID in science class is fairer than excluding it. This belief had a greater impact on tolerance for ID when the issue was framed with respect to fairness. A second study showed similar effects from a pro-ID documentary film. A final study showed that training in scientific reasoning counteracts the impact of the fairness value, thereby decreasing tolerance for ID. Combined, these studies show how political debate can be understood as a contest over which values deserve greatest consideration or emphasis." ;

    schema:about "The imperative of climate justice has been gaining political and discursive power in international climate negotiations. Yet scholars are just beginning to investigate how climate policies are impacting social equity in practice. This paper contributes concrete examples and a multiscalar analysis to this emerging understanding. As cities are increasingly important players in global climate governance, it examines cases from three cities in the global North that have made notable attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a socially just way: Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, England; and Vancouver, British Columbia. These cases show that there is significant potential for cities to further global climate justice through emission reductions while enhancing social justice locally. However, they also demonstrate the importance of understanding just carbon mitigation as a multiscalar phenomenon. In each of these cities, leaders' abilities to mitigate climate change in a just way are shaped by larger processes of changing global markets, political opportunities and constraints, and inconsistent national regulatory environments. To the extent that cities continue to act as important sites of the carbon mitigation necessary to achieve global climate justice, this research highlights the necessity of creating national and global political conditions that enable the implementation of just climate mitigation in urban areas.

    schema:about "A group of Tunisian intellectuals, whom the author dubs 'the professors', has generated a body of thought that responds to the Islamist challenge and to the continuing authoritarianism of the Ben Ali government, which remains committed to secularist policies inherited from the Bourguiba era and to the propagation of an official version of Islam. The professors deny the possibility of unambiguous definition of the Arab-Islamic heritage, the turath, and oppose the use of any ideology derived from that notion. Denouncing Islam as ideology, they evoke the need for a liberal, democratic arena in which notions of truth and policy can be freely debated. They suggest the need for some separation of religion and politics, but they would oppose ideological secularism as much as they oppose any religious ideology. The future of this discourse, which is in a sense both post-modern and post-Islamist, remains uncertain.

    schema:about "How might military service members figure as perpetrators of human rights violations? The question remains a taboo, painful and suppressed topic in United States' face-to-face communities with strong veteran and active-duty presences. Our 2008-2014 ethnographic, team-based anthropological fieldwork focused on a mid-sized American city and its adjacent army base. We argue that the ambiguities and contradictions between soldiers-as-perpetrators and more common and public designations for soldiers and veterans - as heroes, protectors and volunteers, but also as victims of circumstance and injury - impede such exploration. War as a framework for legitimising lethal force complicates what constitutes perpetration, as do the implications of all-volunteer forces fighting protracted campaigns. The legacy of the Vietnam War brings key historicity to civilians' efforts to not repeat the a priori victimisation of veterans as presumed perpetrators, alongside recognition that the signature, psychological and moral injuries of the post-9/11 wars also can render veterans as victims in the public's perspective. Finally, as counterpoint to the generalised avoidance of confronting rights violations, we draw on a journalist's account of a veteran who sought to face an Iraqi victim who lost family members directly; their mutual victimhood is sharply qualified by the civilian's innocence and the veteran's willing volunteerism." ;

    schema:about "'Mild traumatic brain injury' (mTBI) and 'concussion' are terms often used interchangeably. However, 'mTBI' is frequently seen as representing a broader injury that encompasses the construct of 'concussion,' which often conveys transience or decreased severity. The present study examined the influence of varying diagnostic terminology on acute injury expectations in an undergraduate population (N = 105). Participants were presented with an mTBI vignette and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in which the term 'mTBI' or 'concussion' was used to describe the injury. There were no significant differences between the two conditions on anxiety, symptomatology, timeline, or consequence scales. However, participants in the 'mTBI' group allocated more days to return to play than participants in the 'concussion' group, suggesting that terminology has an effect on perceptions of the severity of the injury. Varsity athletes allocated fewer days to return to play than nonathletes. Individuals with a history of concussion, both athletes and nonathletes, indicated fewer days to return to play, but greater symptomatology than individuals with no history of concussion. Clinicians should consider the influence of diagnostic terminology, athletic background, and history of concussion on perceptions of the severity of an injury because expectations can influence injury outcomes and compliance in a recovery process.

    schema:about "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War (1846?1848) and was promoted as a way to extend the right of United States (U.S.) citizenship to Native, African, and Mexican Americans. In reality, the government reneged its responsibilities for federal protection of the rights of its new citizens, and constructed an empire that elevated Euro-Americans' social, economic, and class status, while diminishing the status of others. This article examines how the land grant adjudication process in postwar New Mexico formed a new political economy that adversely affected Mexicana property rights. As my primary source, I use testimonios from the Spanish Archives of New Mexico taken by the U.S. Surveyor General's Office from 1854?1890 to discuss how the testimonios are memories better categorised as an alternative historical archive within the officialised records. Thought of in this way, the testimonios counter traditional historical accounts that elide the importance of matrilineal links to the process of land acquisition in pre-American society, reveal the ambivalence of the land grant adjudication process, and serve as historical memories that reveal the position of Mexicanas as important actors in matters of property ownership, which in turn affected the way Mexicanos were represented within the space of the U.S. courtroom. Further, the testimonios reveal the complex relationship between marginalised and dispossessed Mexicana/o communities and the U.S. government.

    schema:about "This study examines the influence of experience with a second language (L2) on the perception of phonological contrasts in a third language (L3). This study contributes to L3 phonology by examining the influence of L2 phonological perception abilities on the perception of an L3 at the beginner level. Participants were native speakers of Korean whose L2 was English and whose L3 was Japanese. They participated in two perception tasks involving Japanese contrasts and one perception task involving English contrasts. Correlations between Korean participants' perception performance in their L2 and L3 were analysed to determine whether the level of L2 ability was related to the successful perception of phonological contrasts in the L3. The results of the correlation analysis demonstrate that, in general, the better the participants performed in their L2, the better they also performed in their L3, but this result was limited to a few contrasts. The overall findings suggest that L3 learners' phonological perception is positively influenced not only by experience with specific L2 contrasts, but also by the general experience of learning a foreign language, which gives them a global advantage in phonological perception." ;

    schema:about "Both Jung and Kohut place the notion of the discovery of “self” at the center of their psychological theories. Yet where Jung sees this process of discovery as possible only through connecting with the archetypes, which are at once immanent and transcendent, Kohut seemingly veers away from any notion of this in his thought. This article discusses the similarities and differences between Jungian and Kohutian ideas regarding dimensions of self to suggest that Kohut’s discovery of a mature self through cosmic narcissism is indeed touched with overtones of transcendence and spirituality. Raanan Kulka’s work on Buddhism also opens up Kohut’s thought to these dimensions, and greatly increases the possibilities for considering self psychology in spiritual and ethical terms. The term spiritual is used throughout this essay as a sense of participating in a supraordinate being that grants the self a sense of meaning not explicable through everyday experience.

    schema:about "Achieving and maintaining happiness can be difficult, especially when people are not engaging in the activities they know facilitate it. ?Flow? activities require clear rules, challenge, a high investment of energy, and have been shown to promote long-term happiness better than low investment, passive activities. Do people know this? In two studies, we found that, despite recognizing that flow activities are more likely to facilitate happiness, people nevertheless participated in passive leisure significantly more often in a typical week. Participants rated passive activities as being significantly more enjoyable, requiring less effort, and being less daunting to get started than flow activities. Participants? engagement in flow activities was significantly predicted by how enjoyable the activities were perceived to be, whereas how daunting those activities were rated predicted non-engagement. Passive activity engagement was only significantly predicted by enjoyment. Suggestions for enabling people to rise above the barriers to flow activities are offered.

    schema:about "While research on the spatial representation of number has provided substantial evidence for a horizontally oriented mental number line, recent studies suggest vertical organization as well. Directly comparing the relative strength of horizontal and vertical organization, however, we found no evidence of spontaneous vertical orientation (upward or downward), and horizontal trumped vertical when pitted against each other (Experiment 1). Only when numbers were conceptualized as magnitudes (as opposed to nonmagnitude ordinal sequences) did reliable vertical organization emerge, with upward orientation preferred (Experiment 2). Altogether, these findings suggest that horizontal representations predominate, and that vertical representations, when elicited, may be relatively inflexible. Implications for spatial organization beyond number, and its ontogenetic basis, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)" ;

    schema:about "This essay draws on correspondence between Smithsonian Institution curators and Edgar Alexander Mearns, an army surgeon who served in the Philippines during the first decade of the twentieth century, in order to explore ideas about loss in natural history collections. Beneath the appearance of abundance in these collections lies a constant concern with loss, not simply with the loss of specimens to spoil and slippage, but also with the loss of data and sometimes the loss of opportunities to acquire and describe new material. I explore the ways curators considered loss historically but also the ways that reconnecting natural history specimens and field books today offer possibilities for repairing some of these losses and more fully understanding the historical and cultural context of collection.

    schema:about "In this article, I explore what I find to be the essence of Coburn's and Maduro's articles: the tension between thinking of humans as independent selves and as contextually determined. I try to show that this \"dialectical core of self psychology,\" as problematic as it might seem, is necessary if we are to have an adequate basis for a system of ethics and justice, and that the West's overemphasis on autonomy has been deeply injurious. I, then, integrate the two papers by proposing, along with Coburn, that the ability to concomitantly \"own\" one's contextuality and individual freedom is the basis for a new concept of psychological maturity, and that Maduro's concepts of courageous knowing, emotional experiencing, and rigorous relationality are the keys to developing this innovative vision of psychological maturity." ;

    schema:about "Eighteenth-century Arabic manuscripts in the \"uncommon sciences\"-a range of mathematical, astronomical, astrological, medical, and divinatory practices number in the thousands. In light of the economic and social upheaval over the eighteenth century this sustained production must be understood from perspectives of both intellectual and social history. Ahmad al-Damanhuris writings and his rise from rural orphan to head of al-Azhar Mosque suggest the role and value of expertise in the uncommon sciences, particularly as these fields brought religious scholars and ruling military elites into close relations. Precisely because the uncommon sciences bridged these two social classes, this expertise was important for individuals' social and intellectual formation. Recognizing the significance of the uncommon sciences for the history of this period offers a new reading of the work of the chronicler 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, who used language and exemplars from the uncommon sciences to reflect on the proper and just relationship between expertise (embodied by the religious scholarly class) and the emerging state." ;

    schema:about "Premise of research.The serpentine grassland system provides the opportunity to examine whether drought response traits may have contributed to differentiation in the stress-tolerant genus Clarkia. Commonly utilized drought responses might be indicative of traits important to species diversification in stressful environments. Methodology.We examined the drought response strategies of populations of Clarkia gracilis (Onagraceae) from both serpentine and nonserpentine soils. Physiological, morphological, and biomass data were collected under controlled greenhouse conditions. Pivotal results.Serpentine-derived plants exhibited faster growth and germination rates and larger leaf size than nonserpentine-derived plants under increasing water stress, indicating drought escape strategies. However, serpentine-derived plants also employed dehydration avoidance by increasing their water-use efficiency (decreased transpiration rate) under drought stress. In terms of biomass, serpentine-derived plants had a higher fitness potential than nonserpentine-derived plants. Nonserpentine-derived plants tended toward dehydration avoidance through decreased growth rate, decreased transpiration, and smaller leaf size. Conclusions.Our data support transpiration rate as a trait important to stress tolerance. Moreover, serpentine-derived plants avoid drought with drought escape strategies more than nonserpentine plants and may have a higher fitness potential, particularly in water-limiting conditions. Thus, serpentine populations may be competitively superior to nonserpentine populations under drought stress conditions." ;

    schema:about "We present proper motions and astrometric membership analysis for 15,750 stars around the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 6819. The accuracy of relative proper motions for well-measured stars ranges from similar to 0.2 mas yr(-1) within 10' of the cluster center to 1.1 mas yr(-1) outside this radius. In the proper motion vector-point diagram, the separation between the cluster members and field stars is convincing down to V similar to 18 and within 10' from the cluster center. The formal sum of membership probabilities indicates a total of similar to 2500 cluster members down to V similar to 22. We confirm the cluster membership of several variable stars, including some eclipsing binaries. The estimated absolute proper motion of NGC 6819 is mu(abs)(x) = -2.6 +/- 0.5 and mu(abs)(y) = -4.2 +/- 0.5 mas yr(-1). A cross-identification between the proper motion catalog and a list of X-ray sources in the field of NGC 6819 resulted in a number of new likely optical counterparts, including a candidate CV. For the first time we show that there is significant differential reddening toward NGC 6819." ;

These results are the product of our ongoing RV survey of NGC 6819 using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. We also include a detailed analysis of multiple prior sets of optical photometry for NGC 6819. Within a 1 degrees field of view, our stellar sample includes the giant branch, the red clump, and blue straggler candidates, and extends to almost 2 mag below the main sequence (MS) turnoff. For each star observed in our survey we present all RV measurements, the average RV, and velocity variability information. Additionally, we discuss notable binaries from our sample, including eclipsing binaries (WOCS 23009, WOCS 24009, and WOCS 40007), stars noted in Kepler asteroseismology studies (WOCS 4008, WOCS 7009, and WOCS 8007), and potential descendants of past blue stragglers (WOCS 1006 and WOCS 6002). We find the incompleteness-corrected binary fraction for all MS binaries with periods less than 10(4) days to be 22% +/- 3% and a tidal circularization period of 6.2(-1.1)(+1.1) days for NGC 6819." ;

As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we present precise (sigma = 0.38 km s(-1)) radial velocities for proper motion candidate members of NGC 6791 from Platais et al. Our survey, extending down to g' similar to 16.8, is comprised of the evolved cluster population, including blue stragglers, giants, and horizontal branch stars. Of the 280 proper-motion-selected stars above our magnitude limit, 93% have at least one radial velocity measurement and 79% have three measurements over the course of at least 200 days, sufficient for secure radial-velocity-determined membership of non-velocity-variable stars. The Platais et al. proper motion catalog includes 12 anomalous horizontal branch candidates blueward of the red clump, of which we find only 4 to be cluster members. Three fall slightly blueward of the red clump and the fourth is consistent with being a blue straggler. The cleaned color-magnitude diagram shows a richly populated red giant branch and a blue straggler population. Half of the blue stragglers are in binaries. From our radial velocity measurement distribution, we find the cluster's radial velocity dispersion to be sigma(c) = 0.62 +/- 0.10 km s(-1). This corresponds to a dynamical mass of similar to 4600M(circle dot)." ;

    schema:about "The young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 (NGC 2168) has been one of the core clusters of the WIYN Open Cluster Study since 1997. Over these 17 years we have obtained approximately 8000 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of stars in the M35 field, which we provide here. Our target sample consists of 1355 photometrically selected stars in the field of M35 within the main sequence and binary sequence of the cluster and within 13 = 0.6. Using our RV measurements we cleanly separate likely cluster members from field stars. We calculate RV membership probabilities for over 1200 stars in our sample. 418 are probable cluster members, of which 64 are velocity-variable (binary) systems. Here we present 52 orbital solutions for binary members of M35. This sample defines the hard binary population of M35 that dynamically powers the cluster. We also present XMM-Newton X-ray detections within the cluster. We use our large binary sample to search for interacting binaries among the X-ray sources, investigate M35's period-eccentricity distribution, and determine binary frequency. We find a circularization period of 9.9 +/- 1.2 days and a binary frequency of 24% +/- 3% for main-sequence binaries with P < 10(4) days. Determining these properties in a young cluster like M35 is key to defining the initial conditions used in models of cluster dynamical evolution." ;

In the past decade, Chandra X-ray observations have shown a relationship between the X-ray population of globular clusters and their internal dynamics and encounter frequency. We investigate the role dynamics possibly play in the formation of X-ray sources in NGC 6819, and compare our results with known properties of field and globular cluster X-ray populations. We implement a multi-wavelength approach to studying the X-ray sources, utilizing X-ray and UV data from XMM observations along with the wealth of photometry and radial-velocity data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study and the CFHT Open Cluster Survey. Within the cluster half-light radius, we detect 12 X-ray sources down to a luminosity of 10(30) erg s(-1) for cluster members. The sources include a candidate quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (qLMXB), a candidate cataclysmic variable, and two active binary systems. The presence of a qLMXB in an open cluster is previously unexpected given the known relationships between luminous X-ray sources and encounter frequency in globular clusters, and most likely has a dynamical origin." ;

    schema:about "We present results of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey searching for white dwarf (WD) companions to blue straggler stars (BSSs) in open cluster NGC 188. The majority of NGC 188 BSSs (15 of 21) are single-lined binaries with properties suggestive of mass-transfer formation via Roche lobe overflow, specifically through an asymptotic giant branch star transferring mass to a main sequence secondary, yielding a BSS binary with a WD companion. In NGC 188, a BSS formed by this mechanism within the past 400 Myr will have a WD companion that is hot and luminous enough to be directly detected as a FUV photometric excess with HST. Comparing expected BSS FUV emission to observed photometry reveals four BSSs with WD companions above 12,000 K (younger than 250 Myr) and three WD companions with temperatures between 11,000 and 12,000 K. These BSS+WD binaries all formed through recent mass transfer. The location of the young BSSs in an optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) indicates that distance from the zero-age main sequence does not necessarily correlate with BSS age. There is no clear CMD separation between mass transfer-formed BSSs and those likely formed through other mechanisms, such as collisions. The seven detected WD companions place a lower limit on the mass-transfer formation frequency of 33%. We consider other possible formation mechanisms by comparing properties of the BSS population to theoretical predictions. We conclude that 14 BSS binaries likely formed from mass transfer, resulting in an inferred mass-transfer formation frequency of approximately 67%." ;

    schema:about "Measurement of atomic force microscope cantilever spring constants (k) is essential for many of the applications of this versatile instrument. Numerous techniques to measure k have been proposed. Among these, we found the thermal noise and Sader methods to be commonly applicable and relatively user-friendly, providing an in situ, non-destructive, fast measurement of k for a cantilever independent of its material or coating. Such advantages recommend these methods for widespread use. An impediment thereto is the significant complication involved in the initial implementation of the methods. Some details of the implementation are discussed in publications, while others are left unsaid. Here we present a complete, cohesive, and practically oriented discussion of the implementation of both the thermal noise and Sader methods of measuring cantilever spring constants. We review the relevant theory and discuss practical experimental means for determining the required quantities. We then present results that compare measurements of k by these two methods over nearly two orders of magnitude, and we discuss the likely origins of both statistical and systematic errors for both methods. In conclusion, we find that the two methods agree to within an average of 4% over the wide range of cantilevers measured. Given that the methods derive from distinct physics we find the agreement a compelling argument in favour of the accuracy of both, suggesting them as practical standards for the field." ;

We find three hot and young white dwarf companions to blue straggler stars in the 7 Gyr open cluster NGC 188, indicating that mass transfer in these systems ended less than 300 Myr ago. These companions are direct and secure observational evidence that these blue straggler stars were formed through mass transfer in binary stars.

    schema:about "Background and Aims Species of Araceae accumulate calcium oxalate in the form of characteristically grooved needle-shaped raphide crystals and multi-crystal druses. This study focuses on the distribution and development of raphides and druses during leaf growth in ten species of Amorphophallus (Araceae) in order to determine the crystal macropatterns and the underlying ultrastructural features associated with formation of the unusual raphide groove. Methods Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and both bright-field and polarized-light microscopy were used to study a range of developmental stages. Key Results Raphide crystals are initiated very early in plant development. They are consistently present in most species and have a fairly uniform distribution within mature tissues. Individual raphides may be formed by calcium oxalate deposition within individual crystal chambers in the vacuole of an idioblast. Druse crystals form later in the true leaves, and are absent from some species. Distribution of druses within leaves is more variable. Druses initially develop at leaf tips and then increase basipetally as the leaf ages. Druse development may also be initiated in crystal chambers. Conclusions The unusual grooved raphides in Amorphophallus species probably result from an unusual crystal chamber morphology. There are multiple systems of transport and biomineralization of calcium into the vacuole of the idioblast. Differences between raphide and druse idioblasts indicate different levels of cellular regulation. The relatively early development of raphides provides a defensive function in soft, growing tissues, and restricts build-up of dangerously high levels of calcium in tissues that lack the ability to adequately regulate calcium. The later development of druses could be primarily for calcium sequestration." ;

Eight participants were able to successfully fake significantly lower scores without detection by validity indicators. Concussion history was not related to performance. Successful fakers did not perform significantly worse on the Reaction Time Composite and Three Letters Total Letters Correct, questioning the utility of these measures for detecting sandbagging.

    schema:about "The present study explored differences in dendritic/spine extent across several human cortical regions. Specifically, the basilar dendrites/spines of supragranular pyramidal cells were examined in eight Brodmann's areas (BA) arranged according to Benson's functional hierarchy: primary cortex (somatosensory, BA3-1-2; motor, BA4), unimodal cortex (Wernicke's area, BA22: Broca's area, BA44), heteromodal cortex (supplementary motor area, BA6 beta; angular gyrus, BA39) and supramodal cortex (superior frontopolar zone, BA10; inferior frontopolar zone, BA11), To capture more general aspects of regional variability, primary and unimodal areas were designated as low integrative regions: heteromodal and supramodal areas were designated as high integrative regions. Tissue was obtained from the left hemisphere of 10 neurologically normal individuals (M(ago) = 30 +/- 17 years; five males, five females) and stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Ten neurons were sampled from each cortical region (n = 800) and evaluated according to total dendritic length, mean segment length, dendritic segment count, dendritic spine number and dendritic spine density. Despite considerable inter-individual variation, there were significant differences across the eight Brodmann's areas and between the high and low integrative regions for all dendritic and spine measures. Dendritic systems in primary and unimodal regions were consistently less complex than in heteromodal and supramodal areas. The range within these rankings was substantial, with total dendritic length in BA10 being 31% greater than that in BA3-1-2, and dendritic spins number being 69% greater. These findings demonstrate that cortical regions involved in the early stages of processing (e.g. primary sensory areas) generally exhibit less complex dendritic/spine systems than those regions involved in the later stages of information processing (e.g, prefrontal cortex). This dendritic progression appears to reflect significant differences in the nature of cortical processing, with spine-dense neurons at hierarchically higher association levels integrating a broader range of synaptic input than those at lower cortical levels." ;

    schema:about "Although the primate insular cortex has been studied extensively, a comprehensive investigation of its neuronal morphology has yet to be completed. To that end, neurons from 20 human subjects (10 males and 10 females; N = 600) were selected from the secondary gyrus brevis, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus of the left insula. The secondary gyrus brevis was generally more complex in terms of dendritic/spine extent than either the precentral or postcentral insular gyri, which is consistent with the posterior-anterior gradient of dendritic complexity observed in other cortical regions. The male insula had longer, spinier dendrites than the female insula, potentially reflecting sex differences in interoception. In comparing the current insular data with regional dendritic data quantified from other Brodmann's areas (BAs), insular total dendritic length (TDL) was less than the TDL of high integration cortices (BA6 beta, 10, 11, 39), but greater than the TDL of low integration cortices (BA3-1-2, 4, 22, 44). Insular dendritic spine number was significantly greater than both low and high integration regions. Overall, the insula had spinier, but shorter neurons than did high integration cortices, and thus may represent a specialized type of heteromodal cortex, one that integrates crude multisensory information crucial to interoceptive processes." ;

    schema:about "The primate cerebral cortex is characterized by regional variation in the structure of pyramidal neurons, with more complex dendritic arbors and greater spine density observed in prefrontal compared with sensory and motor cortices. Although there are several investigations in humans and other primates, virtually nothing is known about regional variation in the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex of great apes, humans' closest living relatives. The current study uses the rapid Golgi stain to quantify the dendritic structure of layer III pyramidal neurons in 4 areas of the chimpanzee cerebral cortex: Primary somatosensory (area 3b), primary motor (area 4), prestriate visual (area 18), and prefrontal (area 10) cortex. Consistent with previous studies in humans and macaque monkeys, pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of chimpanzees exhibit greater dendritic complexity than those in other cortical regions, suggesting that prefrontal cortical evolution in primates is characterized by increased potential for integrative connectivity. Compared with chimpanzees, the pyramidal neurons of humans had significantly longer and more branched dendritic arbors in all cortical regions." ;

    schema:about "Centromere organization has evolved dramatically in one clade of fungi, the Saccharomycotina. These yeasts have lost the ability to make normal eukaryotic heterochromatin with histone H3K9 methylation, which is a major component of pericentromeric regions in other eukaryotes. Following this loss, several different types of centromere emerged, including two types of sequence-defined (\"point\") centromeres, and the epigenetically defined \"small regional\" centromeres of Candida albicans. Here we report that centromeres of the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) are structurally defined. Each of its four centromeres consists of a 2-kb inverted repeat (IR) flanking a 1-kb central core (mid) region. The four centromeres are unrelated in sequence. CenH3 (Cse4) binds strongly to the cores, with a decreasing gradient along the IRs. Thismode of organization resembles Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres but is much more compact and lacks the extensive flanking heterochromatic otr repeats. Different isolates of K. phaffii show polymorphism for the orientation of the mid regions, due to recombination in the IRs. CEN4 is located within a 138-kb region that changes orientation duringmating-type switching, but switching does not induce recombination of centromeric IRs. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary transitions in centromere organization have occurred inmultiple yeast clades.

    schema:about "Anatectic granites from the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex yield U-Pb zircon crystallization ages that range from 115 to 100Ma, with a dominant grouping at 107-100 Ma, which corresponds to the timing of dome formation during the regional oblique extension that facilitated exhumation of the complex. The occurrence of leucosome-bearing normal-sense shear zones inmigmatitic gneisses indicates that suprasolidus conditions in the crust continued into the early stages of doming and exhumation of the complex. The structure allows access to variably oriented granites in networks of dykes at deeper structural levels and subhorizontal sheeted granites at shallower structural levels within the complex. This feature allows an evaluation of the mechanisms that modify the composition of granite melts in their source and of granite magmas during their ascent and emplacement using whole-rock major, trace element and Sr and Nd isotope compositions, zircon Hf and O isotope compositions, and phase equilibria modelling of potential source rocks. Geochemical variability within the granites is attributed to source heterogeneity and blending of melts, which themselves are consistent with derivation from regional metasedimentary and metaplutonic source materials. The granites typically contain coarse blocky K-feldspar and/or plagioclase grains within interstitial quartz, and have low Rb/Sr ratios and large positive Eu anomalies. These features are inconsistent with the composition of primary crustal melts derived from metasedimentary and metaplutonic source materials, but consistent with early fractional crystallization of feldspar and subsequent drainage of the fractionated melt. Processes such as peritectic mineral entrainment and accessory mineral dissolution, entrainment and crystallization did not have any significant influence on the major and trace element composition of the granites. The granites in the networks of dykes are interpreted to represent choking of magma transport channels through the middle crust as the rate of magma flow declined during doming and exhumation, whereas the sheeted granites record collapse of subhorizontal, partially crystallized layers of magma by filter pressing and melt exfiltration during vertical shortening associated with doming and exhumation. These processes separated feldspar-rich residues from evolved melt. Based on the results of this study, caution is urged in estimating melt proportion from the volume of granite retained in migmatitic gneiss domes, as the granites may not represent liquid compositions." ;

    schema:about "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), chemicals commonly used as flame retardants, are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife. However, little is known about their potential toxicological properties. In the present study, male Long-Evans rats orally administered the commercial PBDE mixture DE-71 or corn oil for 1 week, beginning at postnatal day (PND) 6, were tested on a visual discrimination task and two sustained attention tasks. After completion of these tasks, the rats were administered a drug challenge with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 mg/kg), which was injected subcutaneously 30 min prior to testing on the second sustained attention task. The DE-71-exposed rats demonstrated deficits in learning but not in sustained attention when compared to controls. Scopolamine impaired the animals' ability to detect the brief visual cues in controls, as evidenced by decreases in accuracy and increases in omission errors. However, the DE-71-exposed rats were subsensitive to the effects of scopolamine on omission errors, particularly on trials in which a long delay preceded the cue, suggesting alterations in the cholinergic modulation of sustained attention. For the DE-71-exposed rats, the lack of sustained attention deficits in the absence of the drug, coupled with the subsensitivity to scopolamine's effects on sustained attention, suggest that although this PBDE mixture produced lasting alterations in cholinergic functioning, either (1) these alterations were not of sufficient magnitude to be behaviorally relevant, or (2) behavioral deficits resulting from these alterations were overcome by the development of compensatory neural mechanisms or response strategies in adulthood." ;

    schema:about "The latest Neoproterozoic extinction of the Ediacara biota has been variously attributed to catastrophic removal by perturbations to global geochemical cycles, 'biotic replacement' by Cambrian-type ecosystem engineers, and a taphonomic artefact. We perform the first critical test of the 'biotic replacement' hypothesis using combined palaeoecological and geochemical data collected from the youngest aliacaran strata in southern Namibia. We find that, even after accounting for a variety of potential sampling and taphonomic biases, the Ediacaran assemblage preserved at Farm Swartpunt has significantly lower genus richness than older assemblages. Geochemical and sedimentological analyses confirm an oxygenated and non-restricted palaeoenvironment for fossil-bearing sediments, thus suggesting that oxygen stress and/or hypersalinity are unlikely to be responsible for the low diversity of communities preserved at Swartpunt. These combined analyses suggest depauperate communities characterized the latest Ediacaran and provide the first quantitative support for the biotic replacement model for the end of the Ecliacara biota. Although more sites (especially those recording different palaeoenvironments) are undoubtedly needed, this study provides the first quantitative palaeoecological evidence to suggest that evolutionary innovation, ecosystem engineering and biological interactions may have ultimately caused the first mass extinction of complex life." ;

    schema:about "Interhemispheric communication may be constrained as brain size increases because of transmission delays in action potentials over the length of axons. Although one might expect larger brains to have progressively thicker axons to compensate, spatial packing is a limiting factor. Axon size distributions within the primate corpus callosum (CC) may provide insights into how these demands affect conduction velocity. We used electron microscopy to explore phylogenetic variation in myelinated axon density and diameter of the CC from 14 different anthropoid primate species, including humans. The majority of axons were less than 1 mm in diameter across all species, indicating that conduction velocity for most interhemispheric communication is relatively constant regardless of brain size. The largest axons within the upper 95th percentile scaled with a progressively higher exponent than the median axons towards the posterior region of the CC. While brain mass among the primates in our analysis varied by 97-fold, estimates of the fastest cross-brain conduction times, as conveyed by axons at the 95th percentile, varied within a relatively narrow range between 3 and 9 ms across species, whereas cross-brain conduction times for the median axon diameters differed more substantially between 11 and 38 ms. Nonetheless, for both size classes of axons, an increase in diameter does not entirely compensate for the delay in interhemispheric transmission time that accompanies larger brain size. Such biophysical constraints on the processing speed of axons conveyed by the CC may play an important role in the evolution of hemispheric asymmetry." ;

NFRs associated with transcription initiation sites as well as those not associated with promoters are affected. We dissected the roles of the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and the HP1 proteins Swi6 and Chp2, as well as the two catalytic activities of the SHREC histone deacetylase (HDAC)/ATPase effector complex. Strikingly, different DNA sites have distinct combinatorial requirements for these factors: Five classes of NFRs were identified that are eliminated by silencing factors through a mechanistic hierarchy governed by Clr4. The SHREC HDAC activity plays a major role in the elimination of class I-IV NFRs by antagonizing the action of RSC, a remodeling complex implicated in NFR formation. We propose that heterochromatin formation involves the deployment in several sequence-specific mechanisms to eliminate gaps between nucleosomes, thereby blocking access to the DNA." ;

    schema:about "The Lower Ordovician Shirgesht Formation in central Iran is composed of siliciclastic and carbonate rocks deposited in diverse coastal and marine shelfal environments (tidal flat, lagoon, shoreface, offshore-shelf and carbonate ramp). Five fades associations contain diverse ichnofossil assemblages that show distinct proximal to distal trends formed in a wide range of physical-chemical conditions. The ethological groups of trace fossils in the Shirgesht Formation reflect a gradient of depositional stress conditions across a wave-influenced shoreline and shelf. Deposits of wave influenced environments make up a significant component of the geological record of shallow marine settings, and the ability to determine paleoenvironments in detail in such successions is critical for reconstruction of depositional histories and sequence-stratigraphic interpretation. The Cruziana ichnofacies of the study shows highly diverse suites that record the establishment of a benthic community under stable conditions and a long-term colonization window. The Skolithos ichnofacies recognized is a low diversity opportunistic ichnocommunity suite that resulted from colonization after tempestite deposition in a stressed environment. The strata record an onshore to offshore replacement of the Cruziana ichnofacies (with abundant feeding traces of deposit-feeders) by the Skolithos ichnofacies (dominated by suspension-feeders and predators). A transitional zone between the two ichnofacies coincides with the offshore-transition/distal lower-surface deposits. The distribution of ichnofacies, the diversity and range of ethological characteristics reflected by the ichnogenera, and the wide range of wave-dominated coastal facies demonstrate the potential to use individual trace fossils and ichnofacies for significantly refined palaeoenvironmental analysis of wave dominated coastal settings, particularly in Ordovician successions." ;

    schema:about "Previous scholarship has demonstrated that female lawmakers differ from their male counterparts by engaging more fully in consensus-building activities. We argue that this behavioral difference does not serve women equally well in all institutional settings. Contentious and partisan activities of male lawmakers may help them outperform women when in a polarized majority party. However, in the minority party, while men may choose to obstruct and delay, women continue to strive to build coalitions and bring about new policies. We find strong evidence that minority party women in the U.S. House of Representatives are better able to keep their sponsored bills alive through later stages of the legislative process than are minority party men, across the 93rd110th Congresses (19732008). The opposite is true for majority party women, however, who counterbalance this lack of later success by introducing more legislation. Moreover, while the legislative style of minority party women has served them well consistently across the past four decades, majority party women have become less effective as Congress has become more polarized." ;

    schema:about "Categories can affect our perception of the world, rendering between-category differences more salient than within-category ones. Across many studies, such categorical perception (CP) has been observed for the basic-level categories of one's native language. Other research points to categorical distinctions beyond the basic level, but it does not demonstrate CP for such distinctions. Here we provide such a demonstration. Specifically, we show CP in English speakers for the non-basic distinction between 'warm' and 'cool' colors, claimed to represent the earliest stage of color lexicon evolution. Notably, the advantage for discriminating colors that straddle the warm-cool boundary was restricted to the right visual field, the same behavioral signature previously observed for basic-level categories. This pattern held in a replication experiment with increased power. Our findings show that categorical distinctions beyond the basic-level repertoire of one's native language are psychologically salient and may be spontaneously accessed during normal perceptual processing.

    schema:about "Sex determines much about one's life, but what determines one's sex? The answer is complicated and incomplete: on close examination, ordinary notions of female and male are vague. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee further specified what they mean by woman in response to questions about who, exactly, is eligible to compete in women's Olympic events. I argue, first, that their stipulation is evidence that the use of vague terms is better described by semantic approaches to vagueness than by epistemic approaches. In addition, the IOC's 2012 stipulation was made with sensitivity to its practical consequences. Linguistic actions often have morally relevant consequences, and I contend that, other things equal, we should adopt theories about language that acknowledge the responsibility we bear for what we say. Taking vagueness to be an epistemic phenomenon precludes the sense of agency needed for moral responsibility; taking it to be semantic does not. Thus I advance two arguments for semantic approaches to vagueness, as against epistemic approaches: one descriptive and one normative." ;

    schema:about "Puya (Bromeliaceae), with >?200 species, is a classic example of a recent, rapid species-level radiation in the Andes. To assess the biogeographical history of this primarily Andean species group and the evolution of different life histories, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data were generated for 75 species from throughout the geographical range of the genus. Distribution data for latitudinal and elevational ranges were compiled for almost all species. The greatest number of species is found at mid-elevations and mid-latitudes south of the equator. The genus originated in central Chile and first moved into the Cordillera Oriental of the central Andes via inter-Andean valleys. Cladogenesis progressed in a general south to north direction tracking the final uplift of the Andes. All taxa north of the Western Andean Portal form a monophyletic group implying a single colonization of the northern Andes, with no subsequent transitions back south from the Northern Andes. Repeated evolutionary transitions of lineages up and down in elevation are suggestive of allopatric speciation driven by Pleistocene glaciation cycles. True semelparity evolved once in P.?raimondii, with similar semi-semelparity evolving repeatedly in paramos of the northern Andes. Fieldwork and phylogenetic characterization of high-elevation Puya are priorities for future efforts.

Abstract: De novo malignancies represent an increasing concern in the transplant population, particularly as long-term graft and patient survival improves. EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma in the setting of PTLD is the leading malignancy in children following solid organ transplantation. Therapeutic strategies can be categorized as pharmacologic, biologic, and cell-based but the variable efficacy of these approaches and the complexity of PTLD suggest that new treatment options are warranted. Here, we review current therapeutic strategies for treatment of PTLD. We also describe the life cycle of EBV, addressing the viral mechanisms that contribute to the genesis and persistence of EBV+ B-cell lymphomas. Specifically, we focus on the oncogenic signaling pathways activated by the EBV LMP1 and LMP2a to understand the underlying mechanisms and mediators of lymphomagenesis with the goal of identifying novel, rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.

    schema:about "Using US cross-sectional data, this paper calculates the welfare cost of a 10 percent inflation for different individuals and finds that the difference in cost between the poorest 20 percent, measured by their net worth, and the richest 20 percent is in the order of 102 percent. That is, a poor person is on average willing to forgive 102 percent more of their total consumption in order to have inflation reduced from 10 percent to 0. In absolute terms this represents a cost of 0.461 percent of consumption for the poorest and 0.228 percent for the richest. I accomplish this by introducing preference heterogeneity in a monetary search model first developed by Lagos and Wright, and calibrate the model to match each agent's type of cash holdings, approximated by their holdings in transactional accounts that bear almost no interest, as a fraction of their net worth using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. I also show that this welfare difference increases to 130 percent (2.28 percent for the poorest 20 percent and 0.992 percent for the richest 20 percent) whenever frictions in the use of money are imposed (holdup problem). This distributional effect is further augmented if more frictions in the terms of trade are present. The ability to explicitly model these frictions is the advantage of using this model. Hence, inflation in this framework, as other studies have shown, acts as a regressive consumption tax; and this regressiveness is augmented with the holdup problem." ;

Religious experience, he thought, was integral to the practical mode. The latter experiences the world as interminable tension between what is and what ought to be. The question, Is there a conflict between science and religion ? is, in Oakeshott's approach, the question, Is there a conflict between the scientific mode of experience and the practical mode ? Insofar as we tend to treat every question as a practical one, these questions seem to make sense. But Oakeshott's analysis leads to the view that scientific experience and religious experience are categorically different accounts of experience abstracted from the whole of experience. They are voices of experience that may speak to each other, but they are not ordered hierarchically. Nor can either absorb the other without insoluble contradictions." ;

The intention was to enable, rather than mandate, choices of new equipment. This paper utilizes a unique historical opportunity to test whether electoral equipment follows the pattern predicted by well-established models of innovation diffusion, merging electoral data with census data on socio-economic characteristics. We infer that fiscal constraints to acquisition are strong but not the only limitations to technology adoption, particularly within certain easily identifiable populations." ;

    schema:about "Critical Zone (CZ) research investigates the chemical, physical, and biological processes that modulate the Earth's surface. Here, we advance 12 hypotheses that must be tested to improve our understanding of the CZ: (1) Solar-to-chemical conversion of energy by plants regulates flows of carbon, water, and nutrients through plant-microbe soil networks, thereby controlling the location and extent of biological weathering. (2) Biological stoichiometry drives changes in mineral stoichiometry and distribution through weathering. (3) On landscapes experiencing little erosion, biology drives weathering during initial succession, whereas weathering drives biology over the long term.(4) In eroding landscapes, weathering-front advance at depth is coupled to surface denudation via biotic processes.(5) Biology shapes the topography of the Critical Zone.(6) The impact of climate forcing on denudation rates in natural systems can be predicted from models incorporating biogeochemical reaction rates and geomorphological transport laws.(7) Rising global temperatures will increase carbon losses from the Critical Zone.(8) Rising atmospheric P-CO2 will increase rates and extents of mineral weathering in soils.(9) Riverine solute fluxes will respond to changes in climate primarily due to changes in water fluxes and secondarily through changes in biologically mediated weathering.(10) Land use change will impact Critical Zone processes and exports more than climate change. (11) In many severely altered settings, restoration of hydrological processes is possible in decades or less, whereas restoration of biodiversity and biogeochemical processes requires longer timescales.(12) Biogeochemical properties impart thresholds or tipping points beyond which rapid and irreversible losses of ecosystem health, function, and services can occur." ;

However, no constraints have been placed on potential changes of southeasterly Gulf of Mexico-derived moisture that today contributes considerable precipitation to the easternmost ranges of the southern and middle Rocky Mountains. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains of southern Colorado are ideally situated to assess the relative importance of westerly and southeasterly-derived moisture during the LGM. Based on reconstructions of 30 palaeoglaciers in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, we find that LGM equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) on the east side of the range were systematically 100-200 m lower than ELAs on the west side. The observed ELA pattern is strikingly similar to modern precipitation patterns in the study area, suggesting that southeasterly-derived precipitation had a significant influence on the mass balances of LGM glaciers." ;

Here, we used a Golgi technique to examine different neuronal morphologies in an afrotherian species, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis), and provide a comparison with the related African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Results showed that spiny neurons in the rock hyrax neocortex exhibit less morphological variation than in elephants, displaying a higher frequency of relatively \"typical\" pyramidal neurons. A quantitative comparison of rock hyrax pyramidal neuron morphology between frontal and visual areas, moreover, revealed greater spine density of neurons in frontal cortex, but no differences in other morphological aspects. Regional variations in pyramidal structure have also been observed in the African elephant, as well as a number of primate species." ;

    schema:about "AimThe plant family Goodeniaceae includes 12 genera, largely restricted to Australia. They are a diverse and conspicuous element of the country's ecosystems and an important clade to consider in the effort to reconstruct the historical biogeography of this continent. We used a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny to perform ancestral-area reconstructions for the family, in order to: (1) determine its area of origin; (2) test whether vicariance played a role in the history of lineages occupying the south-western and south-eastern regions; (3) trace diversification processes in the central arid zone; and (4) trace potential eastward dispersals into the Pacific. LocationAustralia and the Pacific. MethodsWe employed a previously published molecular dataset to develop a time-calibrated phylogeny for the Goodeniaceae using beast 1.6.1 with both primary and secondary node calibrations. Ancestral areas were reconstructed via both dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) and statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA). ResultsThe Goodeniaceae split from Asteraceae + Calyceraceae c. 78Ma, with the divergence of the Lechenaultia, Anthotium and Dampiera (LAD) clade from the remainder of the family c. 67Ma. Although the geographical origin of the family is equivocal, the LAD clade originated in south-western Australia, and the remainder of the family, especially Goodenia s.l., probably originated in the central Eremaean zone. The majority of Goodenia cladogenesis events occurred during the Miocene, with expansions to the north, south-east and south-west. The crown radiation of Scaevola s.l. occurred later, during the second half of the Miocene, and has involved several recent extra-Australian dispersals into the Pacific. Main conclusionsAlthough it is unclear where in Australia the family originated, our results support a south-western origin for the LAD clade and considerable diversification of some clades within Goodenia s.l. and Scaevola s.l. in that zone. A relative paucity of mid-Miocene sister relationships between south-western and south-eastern lineages suggests that the occupants of these regions were not affected by contemporary vicariance events. Instead, our results suggest that the aridifying Eremaean zone was an important source and sink for lineages, especially in Goodenia s.l. Dispersal is inferred for the extra-Australian lineages due to their recent origins." ;

    schema:about "Seasonal environmental heterogeneity is cyclic, persistent and geographically widespread. In species that reproduce multiple times annually, environmental changes across seasonal time may create different selection regimes that may shape the population ecology and life history adaptation in these species. Here, we investigate how two closely related species of Drosophila in a temperate orchard respond to environmental changes across seasonal time. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were sampled at four timepoints from June through November to assess seasonal change in fundamental aspects of population dynamics as well as life history traits. D. melanogaster exhibit pronounced change across seasonal time: early in the season, the population is inferred to be uniformly young and potentially represents the early generation following overwintering survivorship. D. melanogaster isofemale lines derived from the early population and reared in a common garden are characterized by high tolerance to a variety of stressors as well as a fast rate of development in the laboratory environment that declines across seasonal time. In contrast, wild D. simulans populations were inferred to be consistently heterogeneous in age distribution across seasonal collections; only starvation tolerance changed predictably over seasonal time in a parallel manner as in D. melanogaster. These results suggest fundamental differences in population and evolutionary dynamics between these two taxa associated with seasonal heterogeneity in environmental parameters and associated selection pressures." ;

    schema:about "In this study, in situ U-Pb monazite ages and Lu-Hf garnet geochronology are used to distinguish mineral parageneses developed during Devonian-Carboniferous and Cretaceous events in migmatitic paragneiss and orthogneiss from the Fosdick migmatite-granite complex in West Antarctica. SHRIMP U-Pb monazite ages define two dominant populations at 365-300Ma (from cores of polychronic grains, dominantly from deeper structural levels in the central and western sectors of the complex) and 120-96Ma (from rims of polychronic grains, dominantly from the central and western sectors of the complex, and from monochronic grains, mostly from shallower structural levels in the eastern sector of the complex). For five paragneisses and two orthogneisses, Lu-Hf garnet ages range from 116 to 111Ma, c. 12-17Ma older than published Sm-Nd garnet ages of 102-99Ma from three of the same samples. Garnet grains in the analysed samples generally have Lu-enriched rims relative to Lu-depleted cores. By contrast, for three of the same samples, individual garnet grains have flat Sm concentrations consistent with high-T diffusive resetting. Lutetium enrichment of garnet rims is interpreted to record the breakdown of a Lu-rich accessory mineral during the final stage of garnet growth immediately prior to the metamorphic peak, and/or the preferential retention of Lu in garnet during breakdown to cordierite in the presence of melt concomitant with the initial stages of exhumation. Therefore, garnet is interpreted to be part of the Cretaceous mineral paragenesis and the Lu-Hf garnet ages are interpreted to record the timing of close-to-peak metamorphism for this event. For the Devonian-Carboniferous event, phase equilibria modelling of the metasedimentary protoliths to the paragneiss and a diatexite migmatite restrict the peak P-T conditions to 720-800 degrees C at 0.45-1.0GPa. For the Cretaceous event, using both forward and inverse phase equilibria modelling of residual paragneiss and orthogneiss compositions, the P-T conditions after decompression are estimated to have been 850-880 degrees C at 0.65-0.80GPa. These P-T conditions occurred between c. 106 and c. 96Ma, determined from Y-enriched rims on monazite that record the timing of garnet and biotite breakdown to cordierite in the presence of melt. The effects of this younger metamorphic event are dominant throughout the Fosdick complex." ;

    schema:about "Determining patterns in annual movements of animals is an important component of population ecology, particularly for migratory birds where migration timing and routes, and wintering habitats have key bearing on population dynamics. From 2009 to 2011, we used light-level geolocators to document the migratory movements of Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus). Four males departed from breeding areas in Colorado for fall migration between 5 and 21 October, arrived in wintering areas in Mexico between 11 October and 3 November, departed from wintering areas from 6 to 21 April, and returned to Colorado between 15 and 21 May. Core wintering areas for three males were located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt Mountains in the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Puebla in central and east-central Mexico, and the core area for the other male was in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains in Tamaulipas. The mean distance from breeding to wintering centroids was 2057 128 km (SE). During fall migration, two males took a southeastern path to eastern Mexico, and two males took a path due south to central Mexico. In contrast, during spring migration, all four males traveled north from Mexico along the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains to the Rio Grande Valley and north through New Mexico. The first stopovers in fall and last stopovers in spring were the longest in duration for all males and located 300-400 km from breeding areas. Final spring stopovers may have allowed male Flammulated Owls to fine tune the timing of their return to high-elevation breeding areas where late snows are not uncommon. One male tracked in both years had similar migration routes, timing, and wintering areas each year. Core wintering and final stopover areas were located primarily in coniferous forests and woodlands, particularly pine-oak forests, suggesting that these are important habitats for Flammulated Owls throughout their annual cycle. RESUMEN El calendario y las rutas de migracion, y las zonas de invernada de Psiloscops flammeolus La determinacion de los patrones de movimientos anuales de los animales es un componente importante de la ecologia de la poblacion, especialmente para las aves migratorias donde el calendario y las rutas de migracion y las zonas de invernada tienen una influencia clave en la dinamica de poblaciones. Desde 2009-2011, se utilizo geolocalizadores sensibles a la luz para documentar los movimientos migratorios de tecolotes flameados (Psiloscops flammeolus). Cuatro machos abandonaron las zonas de reproduccion en Colorado para la migracion de otono entre el 5 al 21 de octubre, luego llegaron al sitio de invernada en Mexico entre el 11 de octubre y el 3 de noviembre, y finalmente abandonaron los sitios de invernada entre el 6 al 21 de abril y regresaron a Colorado entre el 15 y el 21 de mayo. Para tres machos las zonas nucleo de invernada fueron localizadas en las montanas del Cinturon Volcanico Trans-Mexicanos en los estados de Jalisco, Michoacan y Puebla en el centro y el centro-este de Mexico. La zona nucleo del otro macho fue ubicada en las montanas de la Sierra Madre Oriental en Tamaulipas. La distancia media entre las centroides de las zonas de cria y invernada era 2057 +/- 128 (SE) km. Durante la migracion de otono, dos machos tomaron una ruta sudeste hasta el este de Mexico, y otros dos machos tomaron una ruta al sur hasta el centro de Mexico. Durante la migracion de primavera, en cambio, los cuatro machos viajaron al norte desde Mexico a lo largo de las montanas de la Sierra Madre Oriental en el Valle del Rio Grande y al norte a traves de Nuevo Mexico. En el curso de migracion en otono y en primavera, las primeras paradas fueron los mas largos de duracion de todas paradas de los machos y estaban situados entre 300 y 400 km de las zonas de reproduccion. Las paradas finales de primavera pueden haber permitido los buhos machos a ajustar el momento de su regreso a las zonas de cria a altitud elevada, donde no es raro que nieva a fines de la primavera. Un macho seguido en ambos anos tenia el calendario, las rutas de migracion, y las zonas de invernada similares cada ano. Zonas nucleo de invernada y de paradas definitiva fueron localizadas principalmente en bosques de coniferas y en bosques de pino y encino en particular, lo que sugiere que estos bosques son habitats importantes para Psiloscops flammeolus a lo largo de su ciclo anual." ;

This is largely because of the poor age constraint of the Madhubani Group of the upper Ganga Supergroup, which has been variously interpreted as Proterozoic, lower Palaeozoic, or even Mesozoic. To address this issue, we used a low manipulation maceration technique to extract organic-walled microfossils from the Ujhani and Tilhar formations of the lower Madhubani Group. Our study recovered a total of 24 taxa, including Devisphaera corallis gen. et sp. nov. The co-occurrence of Trachyhystrichosphaera aimika, Caudosphaera expansa and Annulusia annulata in the lower Madhubani Group indicates a late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic age. Thus, the biostratigraphical data suggest a > 300 myr depositional gap between the Madhubani Group and the immediately underlying Bahraich Group, which has been independently constrained to be upper Palaeoproterozoic to lower Mesoproterozoic in age. Therefore, the first-order stratigraphic architecture, with a Palaeoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic succession unconformably overlain by a Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic succession, is closely similar throughout the Vindhyan Basin, Ganga Valley and Lesser Himalaya, suggesting a shared sedimentary and tectonic history among them." ;

    schema:about "Philosophers working in bioethics often hope to identify abstract principles and universal values to guide professional practice, relying on ideals of objectivity and impartiality, and on the power of rational (individual, autonomous) deliberation. Such a focus has made it difficult to address issues arising from group-based, sociohistorical differences like race and ethnicity. This essay offers a survey of some of the major issues concerning race in the field of bioethics. These issues include a long history of racialized abuse in medical and scientific research, reproductive injustice and abuse against women of color, and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in U.S. health and health care. The essay also argues that the field of bioethics as a whole would be improved by taking the experience of racial minorities into account in all its theorizing. Philosophers can aid in this task by expanding their theoretical focus beyond questions of individual rights to questions of social justice, beyond informed consent to community collaboration, and beyond cultural competency to both structural competency and cultural humility." ;

Using a single case study, this article expands the application of the ACF to the complex policy subsystem of the U.S. automobile industry during the 2009 auto bailout and subsequent bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler. We examine the development and actions of policy coalitions and further expand the ACF by exploring the role of policy brokers during the automobile crisis. We also examine whether policy brokers are politically neutral actors as previous research debates and what actions they take if compromise cannot be reached between competing coalitions.

    schema:about "Prior studies estimating the impact of amenity accessibility on residential property prices have largely treated housing as a homogenous commodity; however, there is strong evidence that differentiation in metropolitan housing submarkets matters. Using a hedonic pricing approach and controlling for spatial effects, this paper examines the preferences of house and apartment buyers regarding amenity accessibility in Brooklyn, New York, between 2008 and 2013. Amenity preferences between the two types of homebuyers are indeed different. The marginal implicit value of accessibility to cultural amenities is greater to apartment than house buyers, while the marginal implicit value of workplace amenity accessibility is greater to house than apartment buyers. The results illustrate the importance of differentiating housing submarkets when estimating these impacts. Urban policy-makers and real estate developers can use these results to inform land use planning in metropolitan areas aimed at further increasing residential property values.

    schema:about "A variety of unusual early post-depositional deformation structures exist in grainstone and flat-pebble conglomerate beds of Upper Cambrian strata, western Colorado, including slide scarps, thrusted beds, irregular blocks and internally deformed beds. Thrusted beds up to tens of centimetres thick record thrust movement of a part of a bed onto itself along a moderate to steeply inclined (15 degrees to 40 degrees) ramp, locally producing hanging wall lenses with fault-bend geometries. Thrust plane orientations are widely distributed, and in some cases nearly oppositely oriented in close proximity, indicating that they did not form as failures acted upon by gravity forces. Irregular bedded to internally deformed blocks are isolated on generally flat upper bedding surfaces. These features represent parts of beds that detached, moved up onto and some distances across, the laterally adjacent undisturbed bed surfaces. Deformation of thin intervals of mud on the ocean floor by moving blocks rules out the possibility of storm-induced deformation, because the mud was not eroded by high shear stresses that would accompany the extremely large forces required to produce and move the blocks. Finally, internally deformed beds are characterized by large blocks, fitted fabrics of highly irregular fragments and contorted lamination, which represent heterogeneous deformation, such as brecciation and liquefaction. The deformation structures were produced by earthquakes linked to the reactivation of Mesoproterozoic, crustal-scale shear zones in the central Rockies during the Late Cambrian. Analysis of the deformation structures indicates very large body forces and calculated earthquake-generated ground motion velocities of ca 1.6 m sec(-1). These correspond to moment magnitudes of ca 7.0 or more and a Mercalli Intensity of X+. These are the only known magnitude estimates of Phanerozoic (other than Quaternary) large-intensity earthquakes for the Rocky Mountain region, and they are as large as, or larger than, previous estimates of Proterozoic earthquakes along these major shear zones of the central Rockies." ;

We build on advice-taking research from the judgment and decision making literature, which has developed a distinct paradigm to test how accurately people incorporate information from others. We use a literature review to show that people have mixed success in fulfilling informational motives -- they increase their accuracy through the use of advice, but not as much as they could. We develop insights about how people perceive advisors and try to pursue advice -- and where their perceptions may lead them astray. We conclude by proposing that future work further investigate the reasons people fail to use advice by building on the current advice taking paradigm used in judgment and decision making, but with a richer understanding of advice taking as a dynamic process that often entails complex decisions and normative motives.

    schema:about "Objective Human trafficking problems have largely been framed by political elites and the media as a sexual crime involving innocent victims who are largely women and children. It is unclear how this framing impacts the public's attitudes about the issue. Here, we ask what types of sex trafficking victim frames produce the strongest response among the American public and how does increased exposure and accurate knowledge about the issue moderate the impact of the victim frames? Methods To answer these questions, we utilize data from a unique nationally representative survey experiment fielded to 2,000 Americans in which we designed a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment manipulating the gender, age, and nationality of sex trafficking victims. Results We find the age of the victim has the greatest impact on affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to human trafficking, but that these victim frames are conditional on the amount of exposure a subject has had to the issue of human trafficking and the level of correct knowledge he or she possesses about human trafficking. Conclusion Victim framing in public discourse on sex trafficking does make a difference, and the reasons these frames elicit different responses are complex and moderated by respondents’ exposure to information and knowledge about the issue.

The subsurface Ganga Supergroup, representing the sedimentary basement of the Ganga Valley, has been interpreted as a northern extension of the Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup in cratonic India. This interpretation is contentious because the depositional age of the Ganga Supergroup is not resolved: whereas the lower Ganga Supergroup is widely regarded as Proterozoic, the upper Ganga Supergroup has been variously inferred to include Neoproterozoic, lower Palaeozoic, or Cretaceous strata. Here, we integrate biostratigraphic and detrital zircon data from drill cores to show that the entire Ganga Supergroup is likely Proterozoic and can be correlated with Proterozoic successions on the northern Indian craton and in the Lesser Himalaya. This helps redefine the first-order stratigraphic architecture and indicates broad depositional continuity along the northern Indian margin during the Proterozoic." ;

Twitter is increasingly incorporated across the disciplines as a tool to engage with content. In the foreign-language classroom, for instance, Twitter has been used to facilitate language learning, communicate with native speakers, and build community. This article describes how Twitter was initially introduced into an intermediate German classroom to improve communicative competence and foster student engagement. Yet its main focus is on how Twitter was used as the only method of instruction as part of the discussion of Thomas Brussig's 1999 novel Am kurzeren Ende der Sonnenallee. The first section explains the methodology behind using Twitter, and briefly charts the advantages and disadvantages of the social networking tool for honing communicative skills and building community. The second section outlines the classroom unit during which the students and the instructor communicated solely via Twitter. After a discussion of the session, and sample student assignments and reactions, the article concludes by highlighting the educational benefits of Twitter as a playful and motivating approach to teaching literature in the intermediate foreign-language classroom." ;

It is shown that decreases in CA deficits imply increases in tradable relative to non-tradable output and/or declines in investment. The impact of CA rebalancing' should therefore be expected to vary considerably across sectors of an economy. This intersectoral variation is studied by examining the dynamics of output, employment and prices using data for 55 sectors of the economy during 14 industrial country reversal episodes. The output and employment declines associated with CA reversals are most clearly evident in investment-related sectors, while sectors related to primary commodities generally perform relatively well following reversals. Reversals are also followed by increases in relative inflation for tradable goods sectors." ;

Mammal dwarfing has been observed, alongwith other changes in community structure, during the largest of these ancient global warming events, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM; similar to 56 million years ago (Ma)]. We show that mammalian dwarfing accompanied the subsequent, smaller-magnitude warming event known as Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 [ETM2 (similar to 53 Ma)]. Statistically significant decrease in body size during ETM2 is observed in two of four taxonomic groups analyzed in this study andis most clearly observed inearly equids (horses). During ETM2, the best-sampledlineage of equids decreased in size by similar to 14%, as opposed to similar to 30% during the PETM. Thus, dwarfing appears to be a common evolutionary response of somemammals during past globalwarming events, and the extent of dwarfing seems related to the magnitude of the event." ;

The LuxI protein generates the quorum-sensing signal N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL), and LuxR is a signal-responsive transcriptional regulator which activates the luminescence (lux) genes and 17 other V. fischeri genes. For activation of the lux genes, LuxR binds to a 20-base-pair inverted repeat, the lux box, which is centered 42.5 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start of the lux operon. Similar lux box-like elements have been identified in only a few of the LuxR-activated V. fischeri promoters. To better understand the DNA sequence elements required for LuxR binding and to identify binding sites in LuxR-regulated promoters other than the lux operon promoter, we have systematically mutagenized the lux box and evaluated the activity of many mutants. By doing so, we have identified nucleotides that are critical for promoter activity. Interestingly, certain lux box mutations allow a 3OC6-HSL-independent LuxR activation of the lux operon promoter. We have used the results of the mutational analysis to create a consensus lux box, and we have used this consensus sequence to identify LuxR binding sites in 3OC6-HSL-activated genes for which lux boxes could not be identified previously.

    schema:about "Spt6 is a conserved factor, critically required for several transcription- and chromatin-related processes. We now show that Spt6 and its binding partner, Iws1, are required for heterochromatic silencing in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our studies demonstrate that Spt6 is required for silencing of all heterochromatic loci and that an spt6 mutant has an unusual combination of heterochromatic phenotypes compared to previously studied silencing mutants. Unexpectedly, we find normal nucleosome positioning over heterochromatin and normal levels of histone H3K9 dimethylation at the endogenous pericentric repeats. However, we also find greatly reduced levels of H3K9 trimethylation, elevated levels of H3K14 acetylation, reduced recruitment of several silencing factors, and defects in heterochromatin spreading. Our evidence suggests that Spt6 plays a role at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels; in an spt6 mutant, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy at the pericentric regions is only modestly increased, while production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is lost. Taken together, our results suggest that Spt6 is required for multiple steps in heterochromatic silencing by controlling chromatin, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional processes." ;

    schema:about "Tools for visualizing data provide an opportunity for students to build useful understanding of geoscience vocabularies. Edelson's (2001) Learning-for-Use framework serves as an instructional model for designing an experience for students in which they can learn fundamental geoscience concepts. This paper presents results from an experiment on project-based learning with three cohorts (in subsequent semesters) of preservice elementary teachers. The context for the experiment was a capstone science course for preservice elementary teachers. The project consisted of six steps in which students were instructed to create a paleotemperature map of the Late Jurassic. Students made their decisions based on their constructed knowledge about factors that influence near-surface air temperature: latitude (axial tilt and curvature), topography and subsequent lapse rate, atmospheric effect, and surface cover (albedo). Analyses of reflection papers and classroom observations from each step in the project indicated improvement in content knowledge for all student cohorts. However, regarding the ability to perform complex analysis, only students who successfully built new geoscience vocabularies performed better on predicting and defending their final temperature maps. This is attributed to their ability to use, not just define the geoscience vocabularies contained in the project." ;

    schema:about "This field-trip guide outlines the glacial history of the upper Arkansas River valley, Colorado, and builds on a previous GSA field trip to the area in 2010. The following will be presented: (1) new cosmogenic (super 10) Be exposure ages of moraine boulders from the Pinedale and Bull Lake glaciations (Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 6, respectively) located adjacent to the Twin Lakes Reservoir, (2) numerical modeling of glaciers during the Pinedale glaciation in major tributaries draining into the upper Arkansas River, (3) discharge estimates for glacial-lake outburst floods in the upper Arkansas River valley, and (4) (super 10) Be ages on flood boulders deposited downvalley from the moraine sequences. This research was stimulated by a new geologic map of the Granite 7.5' quadrangle, in which the mapping of surficial deposits was revised based in part on the interpretation of newly acquired LiDAR data and field investigations. The new (super 10) Be ages of the Pinedale terminal moraine at Twin Lakes average 21.8 + or - 0.7 ka (n = 14), which adds to nearby Pinedale terminal moraine ages of 23.6 + or - 1.4 ka (n = 5), 20.5 + or - 0.2 ka (n = 3), and 16.6 + or - 1.0 ka (n = 7), and downvalley outburst flood terraces that date to 20.9 + or - 0.9 ka (n = 4) and 19.0 + or - 0.6 ka (n = 4). This growing chronology leads to improved understanding of the controls and timing of glaciation in the western United States, the modeling of glacial-lake outburst flooding, and the reconstruction of paleotemperature through glacier modeling." ;

    schema:about "We report geochemical data from (meta-) sedimentary and igneous rocks that crop out in the Ford Ranges of western Marie Byrd Land and discuss the evolution and reworking of the crust in this region during Paleozoic subduction along the former Gondwanan convergent plate margin. Detrital zircon age spectra from the Swanson Formation, a widespread low-grade metaturbidite sequence, define distinct populations in the late Paleoproterozoic, late Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic-Cambrian. The late Paleoproterozoic group records magmatism derived from a mixed juvenile and crustal source. By contrast, the late Mesoproterozoic group yields Hf isotope values consistent with derivation from a juvenile Mesoproterozoic source inferred to be an unexposed Grenville-age orogenic belt beneath the East Antarctic ice sheet. For the NeoproterozoicCambrian population, Hf isotope values indicate reworking of these older materials during Ross-Delamerian orogenesis. New U-Pb ages from the Devonian- Carboniferous Ford Granodiorite suite across the Ford Ranges reveal an extended period of arc magmatism from 375 to 345 Ma. For four younger samples of Ford Granodiorite, Hf and O isotope values in zircon suggest involvement of a larger (meta-) sedimentary component in the petrogenesis than for two older samples. This contrasts with the secular trend toward more juvenile values documented from Silurian to Permian granite suites in the Tasmanides of eastern Australia and Famennian to Tournasian granite suites in New Zealand, pieces of continental crust that were once contiguous with western Marie Byrd Land along the Gondwana margin. The differences may relate to an along-arc change from the typical extensional accretionary mode in eastern Australia to a neutral or an advancing mode in West Antarctica, and to an across-arc difference in distance from the trench between the New Zealand fragments of Zealandia and western Marie Byrd Land. Upper Devonian anatectic granites in the Ford Ranges most likely record reworking of early Ford Granodiorite suite members during arc magmatism." ;

    schema:about "Cambrian-Ordovician strata of the North China block, one of China's main tectonic provinces, are a thick (up to 1800 m) succession of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. Sedimentological, biostratigraphic, and chemostratigraphic analysis of strata that straddle the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary at the Subaiyingou section in the present-day western part of Inner Mongolia (northwest China) indicate the presence of a significant unconformity between mixed carbonate-fine-siliciclastic strata of the Cambrian Series 3 Abuqiehai Formation, and dominantly carbonate strata of the early Middle Ordovician Sandaokan Formation. The latter is a transgressive systems tract with retrogradationally stacked parasequences that include lowstand shore-line quartz sandstone deposits. The Abuqiehai strata have similar sedimentological characteristics to those of the Cambrian Laurentian inner detrital belt, including slightly bioturbated lime mudstone and marlstone/shale, grainstone, flat-pebble conglomerate, and microbialite. The lower part of the Sandaokan Formation records the rising limb of the middle Darriwilian positive isotopic excursion, recognized herein for the first time in the western North China block. A Cambrian-Ordovician unconformity is developed in many successions globally, and our section in Inner Mongolia records a hiatus of similar timing and duration to a regionally extensive unconformity recorded along the ancient northern Indian continental margin. Other parts of the North China block record a hiatus of much shorter duration but show a similar record of input of siliciclastic sediment above the unconformity. We interpret the western margin of the North China block to have been affected by a regionally significant tectonic event that occurred on the northern margin of east Gondwana, the Kurgiakh or Bhimphedian orogeny. The Inner-Mongolian region was, therefore, likely an along-strike continuation of the northern Indian margin, in contrast to most recent paleogeographic reconstructions." ;

    schema:about "An early Paleozoic tectonic event, the Kurgiakh orogeny, has long been known from the western Tethyan Himalaya, and it is conspicuously recorded by an angular unconformity between Cambrian marine shelf deposits and coarse Ordovician conglomerate, as well as widespread granitic plutons. Although the lateral extent of this event is poorly known, two regions in the central and eastern Himalaya, the Kumaon of India and klippen of Bhutan, contain conglomerate units that may be correlative with this event. In the Kumaon, the Ralam Formation, which contains a basal polymictic conglomerate unit with detrital zircon grains as young as ca. 512 Ma, is overlain by sandstone containing the arthropod walking trace Diplichnites gouldi, an ichnospecies known from Ordovician and younger strata. The late early Cambrian trilobite Redlichia sp., recovered from the underlying Martoli Group, indicates that the conglomerate is post-early Cambrian and, based on stratigraphic analysis, also likely records the Kurgiakh orogeny. In central Bhutan, the lower Paleozoic succession contains conglomerate units with monomictic quartz sandstone clasts and less mature sandstone matrix. These units have also been assigned to a variety of ages, but rocks that apparently underlie these strata contain the Furongian (late Cambrian) zonal trilobite Kaolishania granulosa. Here, we show that detrital zircon ages of a conglomerate clast (no grains younger than = ca. 781 Ma) are distinctly older than those of the matrix, which contains a large peak at 490-500 Ma. Thus, these conglomerate units are also potential lateral correlatives of the Ordovician conglomerate deposits of the western Himalaya. Our paleontological and geochronologic data suggest that the Kumaon and Bhutan conglomerate units, and possible equivalents in Tibet, correlate with those of the western Himalaya. This increases their known along-strike extent by over 1000 km, bringing the total extent to similar to 1200 km. Thus, the Kurgiakh orogeny spanned much of the Himalayan orogen along the northern Gondwanan margin and reflected a widespread tectonic reorganization of the peri-Gondwanan realm to Andean-type margins. Recent work indicates that it also likely extended into the Lhasa block and both the North and South China blocks. This event was associated with widespread ca. 500 Ma arc-related plutonism recorded in the Himalaya, and with abundant detrital zircon grains of that age in younger Himalaya strata. Based on current fossil data, the duration of the hiatus associated with the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary, which separates pre- and post-deformational strata, ranges from 22 to 36 m.y. Available geochronological data do not provide greater constraint. If the event was close in age to the depositional age of the Ordovician molasse, then the main phase of tectonic uplift, erosion, and deposition may have been much later than the presumed Cambrian-Ordovician boundary interval age of ca. 485 Ma." ;

These data are combined with published glacial chronologies across the western United States, and indicate that although the ages of Pinedale terminal moraines vary within individual ranges as well as regionally, most western United States glaciers remained near their Pinedale termini until ca. 16 ka, at which time widespread deglaciation commenced. We hypothesize that the near-synchronous demise of glaciers across the western U. S. between ca. 15 and ca. 13 ka was driven by the first major Northern Hemisphere warming following the Last Glacial Maximum, but that some differences in Pinedale culmination ages can be explained by nonclimatic factors intrinsic to individual valleys. These results suggest the need for caution in focusing exclusively on climate forcings to explain apparent asynchrony in Pinedale maxima." ;

    schema:about "The snowball Earth hypothesis predicts that low-latitude glaciation lasted millions of years while CO2 built up to critical levels to culminate in catastrophic deglaciation in a supergreenhouse climate. The Gaskiers Formation of eastern Newfoundland (Canada) has been attributed to a snowball glaciation event, but the lack of robust paleo-magnetic data and precise geochronological constraints has precluded tests of the hypothesis. Here we present high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology (chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry) from eight tuffs from multiple distant stratigraphic sections that bracket glacial diamictites and the first appearance of large Ediacaran fossils. Including internal error, deposition of the Gaskiers diamictite on the Avalon Peninsula is constrained to have been between 580.90 +/- 0.40 and 579.88 +/- 0.44 Ma, and the Trinity diamictite on Bonavista Peninsula was deposited between 579.63 +/- 0.15 and 579.24 +/- 0.17 Ma. Assuming approximately synchronous deglaciation, these results imply a maximum duration for deposition of the Trinity diamictite of <= 340 k.y.; this is inconsistent with the multimillion year duration predicted by the snowball Earth hypothesis. Our geochronologic data also constrain the first appearance datum of Ediacaran fossils to <9.5 m.y. after the Gaskiers glaciation. Thus, despite existing paleomagnetic constraints that indicate that marine ice sheets extended to low to middle latitudes, it appears that Earth narrowly escaped a third Neoproterozoic snowball glaciation just prior to the late Ediacaran expansion of metazoan ecosystems." ;

    schema:about "Variation in light availability likely impacts the processes that determine the identity of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the host plant, and the resulting changes in fungal composition may modify the plant's growth response to light. Our two field surveys and two field experiments using Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. seedlings show that the identity of the dominant ectomycorrhizal fungus changed in response to natural and experimentally induced variation in light. Plants in low light were mostly dominated by a Cenococcum-like morphotype, and plants in high light were mostly dominated by a Lactarius-like morphotype. The patterns of absolute abundance show the key role of plant size: the absolute abundance of the Lactarius-like morphotype increased with increasing light and increasing root system size, whereas the absolute abundance of the Cenococcum-like morphotype was unrelated to both variables. Root system size increased with light availability. With increasing light, growth of plants dominated by the Lactarius-like morphotype decreased with respect to average plants, and therefore, as the Lac, morphotype was increasing in dominance, it was decreasing in mutualistic effectiveness. Plants dominated by Cenococcum had lower growth compared with plants dominated by Lactarius in low light. However, the effects of the two morphotypes were indistinguishable in high light. Our results are likely driven by an interaction of priority effects and light-limited plant growth." ;

    schema:about "HilA, a Salmonella transcription factor, activates the invF-1 and prgH promoters through binding to the HilA box, which contains 2 copies of a TTKHAT motif separated by a T centered at -45 relative to the start sites of transcription. The N-terminal 112 amino acids of HilA are similar to winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding/transcription activation domains (wHTH DBDs). The remaining 441 amino acids are not similar in sequence to any other well-characterized transcription factors. Here, we report that the wHTH DBD is essential for activation of both promoters, but amino acids 113-554 are only required for normal activation of invF-1. Some alanine substitutions in the putative alpha loop, which connects the recognition and positioning helices in wHTH DBDs, cause a loss-of-activation phenotype. A hilA allele encoding a protein with an alanine substituted for arginine at position 71 in the alpha loop has a loss-of-activation defect exclusively at the prgH promoter. The results suggest distinct roles for one or more domains formed by amino acids 113-554 and for arginine 71 in activation of the 2 promoters." ;

    schema:about "Vibrio fischeri are bioluminescent marine bacteria that can be isolated from their symbiotic animal partners or from ocean water. A V. fischeri population increases exponentially inside the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) while the host is quiescent during the day. This bacterial light organ population reaches stationary phase and then remains high during the night, when the squid use bacterial bioluminescence as a counter-predation strategy. At dawn, host squid release 90%-95% of the light organ contents into the ocean water prior to burying in the sand for the day. As the squid sleeps, the cycle of bacterial population growth in the light organ begins again. These V. fischeri cells that are vented into the ocean must persist under typical marine low nutrient conditions until they encounter another opportunity to colonize a host. We hypothesized that because V. fischeri regularly encounter cycles of feast and famine in nature, they would exhibit the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype. We found that older V. fischeri cells exhibit a Class 2 GASP response in which old cells increase dramatically in frequency while the population of young V. fischeri cells remains almost constant during co-incubation." ;

    schema:about "We investigated the Acinetobacter baylyi gene ACIAD1960, known from previous work to be expressed during long-term stationary phase. The protein encoded by this gene had been annotated as a Conserved Hypothetical Protein, surrounded by putative tellurite resistance (\"Ter\") proteins. Sequence analysis suggested that the protein belongs to the DUF1796 putative papain-like protease family. Here, we show that the purified protein, subsequently named StiP, has cysteine protease activity. Deletion of stiP causes hypersensitivity to tellurite, altered population dynamics during long-term batch culture, and most strikingly, dramatic alteration of normal cell morphology. StiP and associated Ter proteins (the StiP-Ter cluster) are therefore important for regulating cell morphology, likely in response to oxidative damage or depletion of intracellular thiol pools, triggered artificially by tellurite exposure. Our finding has broad significance because while tellurite is an extremely rare compound in nature, oxidative damage, the need to maintain a particular balance of intracellular thiols, and the need to regulate cell morphology are ubiquitous." ;

Here we focus on the natural transformation of A. baylyi ATCC 33305 grown in complex media and seek environmental conditions that appreciably affect transformation efficiency. We find that the transformation efficiency for A. baylyi is a resilient characteristic that remains high under most conditions tested. We do find several distinct conditions that alter natural transformation efficiency including addition of succinate, Fe2+ (ferrous) iron chelation, and substitution of sodium ions with potassium ones. These distinct conditions could be useful to fine tune transformation efficiency for researchers using A. baylyi as a model organism to study natural transformation." ;

    schema:about "The present study quantitatively compared the basilar dendritic/spine systems of lamina V pyramidal neurons across four hierarchically arranged regions of neonatal human neocortex. Tissue blocks were removed from four Brodmann's areas (BAs) in the left hemisphere of four neurologically normal neonates (mean age = 41 +/- 40 days): primary (BA4 and BA3-1-2), unimodal (BA18), and supramodal cortices (BA10). Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Ten cells per region (N = 160) were quantified. Despite the small sample size, significant differences in dendritic/spine extent obtained across cortical regions. Most apparent were substantial differences between BA4 and BA10: total dendritic length was 52% greater in BA4 than BA10, and dendritic spine number was 67% greater in BA4 than BA10. Neonatal patterns were compared to adult patterns, revealing that the relative regional pattern of dendritic complexity in the neonate was roughly the inverse of that established in the adult, with BA10 rather than BA4 being the most complex area in the adult. Overall, regional dendritic patterns suggest that the developmental time course of basilar dendritic systems is heterochronous and is more protracted for supramodal BA10 than for primary or unimodal regions (BA4, BA3-1-2, BA18).

    schema:about "The current study provides a number of novel observations on the organization and structure of the cerebellar cortex of the African elephant by using a combination of basic neuroanatomical and immunohistochemical stains with Golgi and stereologic analysis. While the majority of our observations indicate that the cerebellar cortex of the African elephant is comparable to other mammalian species, several features were unique to the elephant. The three-layered organization of the cerebellar cortex, the neuronal types and some aspects of the expression of calcium-binding proteins were common to a broad range of mammalian species. The Lugaro neurons observed in the elephant were greatly enlarged in comparison to those of other large-brained mammals, suggesting a possible alteration in the processing of neural information in the elephant cerebellar cortex. Analysis of Golgi impregnations indicated that the dendritic complexity of the different interneuron types was higher in elephants than other mammals. Expression of parvalbumin in the parallel fibers and calbindin expressed in the stellate and basket cells also suggested changes in the elephant cerebellar neuronal circuitry. The stereologic analysis confirmed and extended previous observations by demonstrating that neuronal density is low in the elephant cerebellar cortex, providing for a larger volume fraction of the neuropil. With previous results indicating that the elephants have the largest relative cerebellar size amongst mammals, and one of the absolutely largest mammalian cerebella, the current observations suggest that the elephants have a greater volume of a potentially more complexly organized cerebellar cortex compared to other mammals. This quantitatively larger and more complex cerebellar cortex likely represents part of the neural machinery required to control the complex motor patterns involved in movement of the trunk and the production of infrasonic vocalizations.

    schema:about "The current study investigates neuron morphology in presumptive primary somatosensory (S1) and primary visual (V1) cortices of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) as revealed by Golgi impregnation. Sirenians, including manatees, have an aquatic lifestyle, a large body size, and a relatively large lissencephalic brain. The present study examines neuron morphology in 3 cortical areas: in S1, dorsolateral cortex area 1 (DL1) and cluster cortex area 2 (CL2) and in V1, dorsolateral cortex area 4 (DL4). Neurons exhibited a variety of morphological types, with pyramidal neurons being the most common. The large variety of neuron types present in the manatee cortex was comparable to that seen in other eutherian mammals, except for rodents and primates, where pyramid-shaped neurons predominate. A comparison between pyramidal neurons in S1 and V1 indicated relatively greater dendritic branching in S1. Across all 3 areas, the dendritic arborization pattern of pyramidal neurons was also similar to that observed previously in the afrotherian rock hyrax, cetartiodactyls, opossums, and echidnas but did not resemble the widely bifurcated dendrites seen in the large-brained African elephant. Despite adaptations for an aquatic environment, manatees did not share specific neuron types such as tritufted and star-like neurons that have been found in cetaceans. Manatees exhibit an evolutionarily primitive pattern of cortical neuron morphology shared with most other mammals and do not appear to have neuronal specializations for an aquatic niche. (C) 2016 S.

    schema:about "Most of the species studied in this paper have previously been placed in either Pleurothallis or Lepanthes. However, at one time or another, members of the group have also been placed in the genera Andinia, Brachycladium, Lueranthos, Masdeval-liantha, Neooreophilus, Oreophilus, Penducella, Salpistele and Xenosia. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ITS and plastid matK sequences indicate that these species form a strongly supported clade that is only distantly related to Lepanthes and is distinct from Pleurothallis and Salpistele. Since this clade includes the type species of Andinia, A. dielsii, and it has taxonomic precedence over all other generic names belonging to this group, Andinia is re-circumscribed and expanded to include 72 species segregated into five subgenera: Aenigma, Andinia, Brachycladium, Masdevalliantha and Minuscula. The required taxonomic transfers are made herein. We hypothesize that convergent evolution towards a similar pollinator syndrome involving deceit pollination via pseudocopulation by Diptera resulted in a similar floral morphology between species of subgenus Brachycladium and species of Lepanthes; hence the prior placement of the species of subgenus Brachycladium in Lepanthes. Species of the re-circumscribed Andinia are confined exclusively to the Andes, ranging from about 1,200 to 3,800 m, from Colombia south to Bolivia, making the generic name very apt. Elevational distributions of the individual clades are discussed in relation to the possible evolutionary diversification of the most species-rich clade, subgenus Brachycladium." ;

Changes in the pigments used at different times have been invaluable in detecting incongruities that suggest fraud, but relatively little work has been published that uses the chemical changes in oil binders as they dry to determine when an ink print or an oil painting was made. Using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy and samples with known dates, we calibrate the drying of oil binders in inks and paints and cross-validate the paints with pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). We apply the ink calibration to a case study involving the age determination of possible philatelic counterfeits from a World War II Jewish Ghetto in Occupied Poland, obtaining a date of 1946 +/- 6 (1 s, n = 9) for the genuine stamps, and 1963 +/- 16 (1 s, n = 19) for the various reproductions." ;

Santa Eulalia is situated in the center of the Kanjobal Indian region in the department of Huehuetenango in Guatemala. The department of Huehuetenango is located in the western Altiplano region of the country, a region in which the Indian population is primarily concentrated. Although no firm estimates exist on the total number of indigenous Guatemalans, analysts assert that over 40 percent of the country's 9 million inhabitants are Indians. The Kanjobales are one of 22 distinct indigenous groups in Guatemala and are the descendants of the Mayan Indians. The Quiches, Mames, Cakchiqueles and Kechis are the most numerous, perhaps numbering 3 million persons. The remaining groups in size with the Kanjobales numbering perhaps 100,000-150,000. International migration to the U.S. from the Kanjobal region of northern Huehuetenango can be characterized as having occurred in three distinct stages: pioneer, war refugee and youth-driven migration, and was preceded by internal migration in the 1940-70 period." ;

We employed an interview protocol from a stratified convenience sample (n = 14) of clandestinely serving active duty, guard and reserve military members from the US Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps who self-identified as transgender or transsexual. Using phenomenology as a methodological foundation, we present a revelatory case study based on lived experiences from firsthand accounts furthering the collective understanding of gender dysphoria in a contemporary military context." ;

    schema:about "This study examines partnerships between the military and local communities by exploring communication channels of the U.S. military and civilian agencies that provide services to transitioning military members. This article reports on a study conducted in 2013 in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area, designed to determine the degree to which the military enters into partnerships with civilian service providers. We find that navy agencies in Hampton Roads do work with community partners, but the military is more directive than one might imagine in a true partnership, leading to \"uneasy\" partnerships. Additionally, there are important structural and organizational barriers that prevent true partnerships from developing between navy agencies and the community providers." ;

    schema:about "Social interaction is a central feature of people's life and engages a variety of cognitive resources. Thus, social interaction should facilitate general cognitive functioning. Previous studies suggest such a link, but they used special populations (e. g., elderly with cognitive impairment), measured social interaction indirectly (e. g., via marital status), and only assessed effects of extended interaction in correlational designs. Here the relation between mental functioning and direct indicators of social interaction was examined in a younger and healthier population. Study 1 using survey methodology found a positive relationship between social interaction, assessed via amount of actual social contact, and cognitive functioning in people from three age groups including younger adults. Study 2 using an experimental design found that a small amount of social interaction (10 min) can facilitate cognitive performance. The findings are discussed in the context of the benefits social relationships have for so many aspects of people's lives." ;

    schema:about "Over the past decade, more than 25 U.S. states enacted legislation surrounding abortions. By analyzing state abortion legislation and proxying how the cost of obtaining an abortion varies across states, this study assesses the implications of legislative changes on women?s contraceptive choices. Examining women by race/ethnicity, income, age, and religious affiliation, the results show that women respond to increased restrictions on abortion availability and cost but that the effects are very small. This study demonstrates that legislation restricting women?s access to abortions fails to promote greater use of more effective contraceptive methods, increasing the likelihood of unwanted births and illegal abortion procedures.JEL Classifications: D1, D81, I18, J13 ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]; Copyright of American Economist is the property of Sage Publications Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

    schema:about "As the paradigm shift from command-and-control statutes to collaborative partnerships increases, public administrators, policy makers, and watershed stakeholders will become more dependent on collaborative partnerships to solve complex environmental problems. This article explores watershed management partnerships and suggests a new typology of collaboration built on the variable of governance. The typology categorizes three types of watershed partnerships as interagency governance, cross-sector governance, and grassroots governance. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of watershed partnerships through the lens of governance structure will enhance public administrator and policy makers? abilities to provide the best approach for addressing a particular watershed goal.

    schema:about "Many scholars argue that intimate partner violence is too complex to address through the \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches that are common in most criminal justice venues. Instead, they advocate for coordinated approaches that address the unique circumstances of each offender. For 3 years, El Paso County ran a \"Pilot Program,\" which applied in-depth analytical tools to tailor court orders to each defendant. The program, to which offenders were randomly assigned, ran parallel to the county's \"one-size-fits-all\" program, providing a rare opportunity to assess the efficacy of each approach. We find the Pilot Program significantly increased compliance and reduced the likelihood of recidivism." ;

    schema:about "Psychological research has devoted much attention to how people judge and predict others. However, a full understanding of social perception necessitates incorporating the responses of the targets, who may have little interest in being predicted. The authors argue that whether people want to be predicted depends on the interpersonal context-in particular, competitive or cooperative ones. Study 1 used a unique behavioral measure and showed that competition participants, when asked to draw the flight path of a moth in a separate study, produced significantly more variable and significantly less predictable trajectories than did cooperation participants. Study 2 examined participants' self-assessments and showed that participants expecting a competitive interaction indicated that they were more difficult to predict, less willing to open up, and more willing to mislead. Together, the findings suggest that people are not always open to being predicted and that the form of these tendencies depends on features of the situation." ;

    schema:about "Settlement pattern data in the lower Salt River valley of central Arizona, near Phoenix, have led to different models of Hohokam political community organization during the early Classic period (ca. A.D. 1150-1300). The \"focal village\" model posits political communities centered on a single large village with monumental architecture surrounded by smaller settlements. The \"linear community\" model envisions an elongated arrangement integrating populations distributed along the routes of irrigation canals. Each model has implications for the nature of cooperation within and between settlement clusters and the degree to which large-scale irrigation management influenced the development of Hohokam, community organization. In this analysis, ceramic sourcing studies are used to outline networks of interaction to examine the different models. Our results provide some evidence for a crosscutting patchwork of geographically dispersed social groups which firs most comfortably within the linear community model." ;

    schema:about "Bulge loops are common features of RNA structures that are involved in the formation of RNA tertiary structures and are often sites for interactions with proteins and ions. Minimal thermodynamic data currently exist on the bulge size and sequence effects. Using thermal denaturation methods, thermodynamic properties of 1- to 5-nt adenine and guanine bulge loop constructs were examined in 10 mM MgCl2 or 1 M KCI. The Delta G(37)degrees loop parameters for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loops in RNA constructs were between 3.07 and 5.31 kcal/mol in 1 M KCl buffer. In 10 mM magnesium ions, the Delta Delta G degrees values relative to 1 M KCl were 0.47-2.06 kcal/mol more favorable for the RNA bulge loops. The Delta G(37)degrees loop parameters for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loops in DNA constructs were between 4.54 and 5.89 kcal/mol. Only 4- and 5-nt guanine constructs showed significant change in stability for the DNA constructs in magnesium ions. A linear correlation is seen between the size of the bulge loop and its stability. New prediction models are proposed for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loops in RNA and DNA in 1 M KCl. We show that a significant stabilization is seen for small bulge loops in RNA in the presence of magnesium ions. A prediction model is also proposed for 1- to 5-nt purine bulge loop RNA constructs in 10 mM magnesium chloride." ;

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we observed that arrays of MS2 binding sites inhibit 5' to 3' degradation of the mRNA in yeast cells and lead to the accumulation of a 3' mRNA fragment containing the MS2 binding sites. This accumulation can be dependent on the binding of the MS2 stem loops (MS2-SL) by MS2 coat proteins (MCPs). Since such decay fragments can still bind MCP-GFP, the localization of such mRNA fragments can complicate the interpretation of the localization of full-length mRNA in vivo." ;

    schema:about "Atmosphere-surface exchange of mercury, although a critical component of its global cycle, is currently poorly constrained. Here we use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to interpret atmospheric Hg-0 (gaseous elemental mercury) data collected during the 2013 summer Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) aircraft campaign as well as ground-and ship-based observations in terms of their constraints on the atmosphere-surface exchange of Hg-0 over eastern North America. Model-observation comparison suggests that the Northwest Atlantic may be a net source of Hg-0, with high evasion fluxes in summer (our best sensitivity simulation shows an average oceanic Hg-0 flux of 3.3 ng m(-2) h(-1) over the Northwest Atlantic), while the terrestrial ecosystem in the summer of the eastern United States is likely a net sink of Hg-0 (our best sensitivity simulation shows an average terrestrial Hg-0 flux of -0.6 ng m(-2) h(-1) over the eastern United States). The inferred high Hg-0 fluxes from the Northwest Atlantic may result from high wet deposition fluxes of oxidized Hg, which are in turn related to high precipitation rates in this region. We also find that increasing simulated terrestrial fluxes of Hg-0 in spring compared to other seasons can better reproduce observed seasonal variability of Hg-0 concentration at ground-based sites in eastern North America." ;

    schema:about "The confluence of rising drug costs, more effective innovative medicines, and increasing public outrage have intensified the debate over pharmaceutical prices and access. We propose an alternative to the traditional patent system, providing direct tax credits to the pharmaceutical patent-holder in exchange for marginal cost pricing of the drug. This proposal is especially suited to the pharmaceutical industry, which produces a social good characterized by high fixed costs, high information and regulatory costs, and relatively low marginal costs of production. While preserving incentives to innovate, we posit that access and consumer surplus should increase through the elimination of monopoly prices.

    schema:about "In haploid cells of Ogataea (Hansenula) polymorpha an environmental signal, nitrogen starvation, induces a reversible change in the structure of a chromosome. This process, mating-type switching, inverts a 19-kb DNA region to place either MATa or MATa genes under centromeric repression of transcription, depending on the orientation of the region. Here, we investigated the genetic pathway that controls switching. We characterized the transcriptomes of haploid and diploid O. polymorpha by RNAseq in rich and nitrogen-deficient media, and found that there are no constitutively a-specific or a-specific genes other than the MAT genes themselves. We mapped a switching defect in a sibling species (O. parapolymorpha strain DL-1) by interspecies bulk segregant analysis to a frameshift in the transcription factor EFG1, which in Candida albicans regulates filamentous growth and white-opaque switching. Gene knockout, overexpression and ChIPseq experiments show that EFG1 regulates RME1, which in turn regulates STE12, to achieve mating-type switching. All three genes are necessary both for switching and for mating. Overexpression of RME1 or STE12 is sufficient to induce switching without a nitrogen depletion signal. The homologous recombination genes RAD51 and RAD17 are also necessary for switching. The pathway controlling switching in O. polymorpha shares no components with the regulation of HO in S. cerevisiae, which does not involve any environmental signal, but it shares some components with mating-type switching in Kluyveromyces lactis and with white-opaque phenotypic switching in C. albicans.

    schema:about "The B lymphotrophic ?-herpesvirus EBV is associated with a variety of lymphoid- and epithelial-derived malignancies, including B cell lymphomas in immunocompromised and immunosuppressed individuals. The primary oncogene of EBV, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to induce the autocrine growth factor, IL-10, in EBV-infected B cells, but the mechanisms underlying PI3K activation remain incompletely understood. Using small molecule inhibition and siRNA strategies in human B cell lines expressing a chimeric, signaling-inducible LMP1 protein, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)-LMP1, we show that NGFR-LMP1 utilizes Syk to activate PI3K/Akt signaling and induce IL-10 production. NGFR-LMP1 signaling induces phosphorylation of BLNK, a marker of Syk activation. Whereas Src kinases are often required for Syk activation, we show here that PI3K/Akt activation and autocrine IL-10 production by NGFR-LMP1 involves the Src family kinase Fyn. Finally, we demonstrate that NGFR-LMP1 induces phosphorylation of c-Cbl in a Syk- and Fyn-dependent fashion. Our results indicate that the EBV protein LMP1, which lacks the canonical ITAM required for Syk activation, can nevertheless activate Syk, and the Src kinase Fyn, resulting in downstream c-Cbl and PI3K/Akt activation. Fyn, Syk, and PI3K/Akt antagonists thus may present potential new therapeutic strategies that target the oncogene LMP1 for treatment of EBV+ B cell lymphomas.

    schema:about "The mental number line, with its left-to-right orientation of increasing numerical values, is often regarded as evidence for a unique connection between space and number. Yet left-to-right orientation has been shown to extend to other dimensions, consistent with a general magnitude system wherein different magnitudes share neural and conceptual resources. Such observations raise a fundamental, yet relatively unexplored, question about spatial-numerical associations: What is the nature of the information represented along the mental number line? Here we show that this information is not exclusive to number, simultaneously accommodating numerical and non-numerical magnitudes. Participants completed the classic SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes) task while sometimes wearing wrist weights. Weighting the left wrist?thereby linking less and more weight to right and left, respectively?worked against left-to-right orientation of number, leaving no behavioral trace of the mental number line. Our findings point to the dynamic integration of magnitude dimensions, with spatial organization instantiating representational currency (i.e., more/less relations) shared across magnitudes.

    schema:about "The addition of charcoal (or biochar) to soil has significant carbon sequestration and agronomic potential, making it important to determine how this potentially large anthropogenic carbon influx will alter ecosystem functions. We used column experiments to quantify how hydrologic and nutrient-retention characteristics of three soil materials differed with biochar amendment. We compared three homogeneous soil materials (sand, organic-rich topsoil, and clay-rich Hapludert) to provide a basic understanding of biochar-soil-water interactions. On average, biochar amendment decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) by 92% in sand and 67% in organic soil, but increased K by 328% in clay-rich soil. The change in K for sand was not predicted by the accompanying physical changes to the soil mixture; the sand-biochar mixture was less dense and more porous than sand without biochar. We propose two hydrologic pathways that are potential drivers for this behavior: one through the interstitial biochar-sand space and a second through pores within the biochar grains themselves. This second pathway adds to the porosity of the soil mixture; however, it likely does not add to the effective soil K due to its tortuosity and smaller pore size. Therefore, the addition of biochar can increase or decrease soil drainage, and suggests that any potential improvement of water delivery to plants is dependent on soil type, biochar amendment rate, and biochar properties. Changes in dissolved carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes also differed; with biochar increasing the C flux from organic-poor sand, decreasing it from organic-rich soils, and retaining small amounts of soil-derived N. The aromaticity of C lost from sand and clay increased, suggesting lost C was biochar-derived; though the loss accounts for only 0.05% of added biochar-C. Thus, the direction and magnitude of hydraulic, C, and N changes associated with biochar amendments are soil type (composition and particle size) dependent." ;

    schema:about "Core Goodeniaceae is a clade of similar to 330 species primarily distributed in Australia. Considerable variation in flower morphology exists within this group and we aim to use geometric morphometrics to characterize this variation across the two major subclades: Scaevola sensu lato (s. l.) and Goodenia s. l., the latter of which was hypothesized to exhibit greater variability in floral symmetry form. We test the hypothesis that floral morphological variation can be adequately characterized by our morphometric approach, and that discrete groups of floral symmetry morphologies exist, which broadly correlate with subjectively determined groups. From 335 images of 44 species in the Core Goodeniaceae, two principal components were computed that describe >98% of variation in all datasets. Increasing values of PC1 ventralize the dorsal petals (increasing the angle between them), whereas increasing values of PC2 primarily ventralize the lateral petals (decreasing the angle between them). Manipulation of these two morphological \"axes\" alone was sufficient to recreate any of the general floral symmetry patterns in the Core Goodeniaceae. Goodenia s. l. exhibits greater variance than Scaevola s. l. in PC1 and PC2, and has a significantly lower mean value for PC1. Clustering clearly separates fan-flowers (with dorsal petals at least 120 degrees separated) from the others, whereas the distinction between pseudo-radial and bilabiate clusters is less clear and may form a continuum rather than two distinct groups. Transitioning from the average fan-flower to the average non-fanflower is described almost exclusively by PC1, whereas PC2 partially describes the transition between bilabiate and pseudo-radial morphologies. Our geometric morphometric method accurately models Core Goodeniaceae floral symmetry diversity." ;

    schema:about "Here we present an examination of type IV pilus genes associated with competence and twitching in the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi (strain ADP1, BD413). We used bioinformatics to identify potential competence and twitching genes and their operons. We measured the competence and twitching phenotypes of the bioinformatically-identified genes. These results demonstrate that competence and twitching in A. baylyi both rely upon a core of the same type IV pilus proteins. The core includes the inner membrane assembly platform (PilC), a periplasmic assemblage connecting the inner membrane assembly platform to the secretin (ComM), a secretin (ComQ) and its associated pilotin (PilF) that assists with secretin assembly and localization, both cytoplasmic pilus retraction ATPases (PilU, PilT), and pilins (ComP, ComB, PilX). Proteins not needed for both competence and twitching are instead found to specialize in either of the two traits. The pilins are varied in their specialization with some required for either competence (FimT) and others for twitching (ComE). The protein that transports DNA across the inner membrane (ComA) specializes in competence, while signal transduction proteins (PilG, PilS, and PilR) specialize in twitching. Taken together our results suggest that the function of accessory proteins should not be based on homology alone. In addition the results suggest that in A. baylyi the mechanisms of natural transformation and twitching are mediated by the same set of core Type IV pilus proteins with distinct specialized proteins required for each phenotype. Finally, since competence requires multiple pilins as well as both pilus retraction motors PilU and PilT, this suggests that A. baylyi employs a pilus in natural transformation.

    schema:about "Women are underrepresented in a number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Limited diversity in the development of the STEM workforce has negative implications for scientific innovation, creativity, and social relevance. The current study reports the first-year results of the PROmoting Geoscience Research, Education, and SuccesS (PROGRESS) program, a novel theory-driven informal mentoring program aimed at supporting first- and second-year female STEM majors. Using a prospective, longitudinal, multi-site (i.e., 7 universities in Colorado/Wyoming Front Range &amp; Carolinas), propensity score matched design, we compare mentoring and persistence outcomes for women in and out of PROGRESS (N = 116). Women in PROGRESS attended an off-site weekend workshop and gained access to a network of volunteer female scientific mentors from on- and off-campus (i.e., university faculty, graduate students, and outside scientific professionals). The results indicate that women in PROGRESS had larger networks of developmental mentoring relationships and were more likely to be mentored by faculty members and peers than matched controls. Mentoring support from a faculty member benefited early-undergraduate women by strengthening their scientific identity and their interest in earth and environmental science career pathways. Further, support from a faculty mentor had a positive indirect impact on women's scientific persistence intentions, through strengthened scientific identity development. These results imply that first- and second- year undergraduate women's mentoring support networks can be enhanced through provision of protÃ©gÃ© training and access to more senior women in the sciences willing to provide mentoring support.

To alter the relationship of the subject to the normative progression of time or, more radically, to alter temporality itself is to fracture the firmament of the Modern as both a discernible epoch and its existence as context for thinking. This paper is to examine avant garde jazz music and its abandonment of the fundamentals of western music, particularly meter, as a foray into the creation of a sonic representation of alternative modes of subjective relation to temporality. This art is further analyzed in relation to the conception of subjectivity provided by Ellison and Du Bois, and regarded as an attempt to create a revolutionary space of radical freedom for the radical \"Other\"." ;

    schema:about "According to Kierkegaard, love plays a foundational role in human existence. In Works of Love, he identifies love as 'the deepest ground' of existence and as 'the source of everything,' a 'passion of the emotions' that exerts its influence like a 'hidden spring,' flowing from a single source 'along many paths' and 'forming the heart' of each human being. In this paper, I explain how love can provide grounding and orientation in the ways that Kierkegaard claims it can. Love is manifested in different forms, all of which are subject to the imperative of loving thy neighbor as thyself: it permits us to realize our own individuality and to appreciate the distinct existence of other persons, thus enabling us to inhabit a meaningful world. Thus, at the same time, love enables us to be and also to know.

    schema:about "Warmth and competence are fundamental dimensions used to characterize people, animals, and even corporations. Based on observations from a preliminary survey (Study 1) on the impact of scandals on several brands, we predicted that an organization that caused a disaster would be judged more harshly if its warmth rather than competence reputation was called into question. Study 1 surveyed a nationally representative sample of American adults and results showed that not all scandals had the same consequences on the perception of warmth, competence, and on consumer attitudes. Study 2 suggested that framing the cause of a local environmental disaster in terms of low warmth resulted in harsher judgments toward the responsible organization than framing the cause related to incompetence. Study 3 found that a warmth frame for post-disaster cleanup was ineffective compared to a competence frame. These results suggested that warmth and competence shape perceivers' blame attribution following a corporate or organizational disaster." ;

    schema:about "The regulation of dendritic branching is critical for sensory reception, cell-cell communication within the nervous system, learning, memory, and behavior. Defects in dendrite morphology are associated with several neurologic disorders; thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern dendrite morphogenesis is important. Recent investigations of dendrite morphogenesis have highlighted the importance of gene regulation at the posttranscriptional level. Because RNA-binding proteins mediate many posttranscriptional mechanisms, we decided to investigate the extent to which conserved RNA-binding proteins contribute to dendrite morphogenesis across phyla. Here we identify a core set of RNA-binding proteins that are important for dendrite morphogenesis in the PVD multidendritic sensory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans. Homologs of each of these genes were previously identified as important in the Drosophila melanogaster dendritic arborization sensory neurons. Our results suggest that RNA processing, mRNA localization, mRNA stability, and translational control are all important mechanisms that contribute to dendrite morphogenesis, and we present a conserved set of RNA-binding proteins that regulate these processes in diverse animal species. Furthermore, homologs of these genes are expressed in the human brain, suggesting that these RNA-binding proteins are candidate regulators of dendrite development in humans." ;

    schema:about "Effective boundary mechanisms halt the spread of repressive histone methylation. In the fission yeast Schizosacchromyces pombe, two factors/elements required for boundary function have been described, the jmjC protein Epe1 and binding sites for the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC. Perplexingly, individual mutation of Epe1 or TFIIIC sites produces only mild boundary defects, and no other boundary factors have been identified. To approach these issues, we developed a synthetic reporter gene tool that uses a tethered Clr4 histone H3K9 methyltransferase and monitors the ability of a DNA element to block heterochromatin spread. The inverted repeat (IR) that flanks the mat2/3 silent mating-type cassette region demonstrates strong boundary activity compared to sequences that flank pericentromeric heterochromatic repeats. Rather than acting in the same inhibitory pathway, Epe1 and TFIIIC sites mediate boundary function of the IR via the two parallel and largely redundant pathways. We also use the system to demonstrate that HP1/Swi6 promotes boundary activity in addition to promoting silencing and acts in the same pathway as Epe1. Inhibition of heterochromatin spread at the endogenous IR element also requires either Epe1 or TFIIIC sites. Strikingly, mutation of both mechanisms results in growth inhibition that is associated with the spread of heterochromatin over many kilobases to the nearest essential gene and the near-complete silencing of several intervening euchromatic genes. The growth defect is reversed by deletion of clr4+, indicating that the redundant boundary mechanisms protect cells from intrinsic toxicity caused by the spread of heterochromatin." ;

    schema:about "Cell differentiation in yeast species is controlled by a reversible, programmed DNA-rearrangement process called mating-type switching. Switching is achieved by two functionally similar but structurally distinct processes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In both species, haploid cells possess one active and two silent copies of the mating-type locus (a three-cassette structure), the active locus is cleaved, and synthesis-dependent strand annealing is used to replace it with a copy of a silent locus encoding the opposite mating-type information. Each species has its own set of components responsible for regulating these processes. In this review, we summarize knowledge about the function and evolution of mating-type switching components in these species, including mechanisms of heterochromatin formation, MAT locus cleavage, donor bias, lineage tracking, and environmental regulation of switching. We compare switching in these well-studied species to others such as Kluyveromyces lactis and the methylotrophic yeasts Ogataea polymorpha and Komagataella phaffii. We focus on some key questions: Which cells switch mating type? What molecular apparatus is required for switching? Where did it come from? And what is the evolutionary purpose of switching?" ;

    schema:about "Of the eight subfamilies currently recognized in Bromeliaceae, Bromelioideae is perhaps the most poorly understood. Generic circumscriptions are unclear, and an exceptionally diverse morphology coupled with an unusually low rate of sequence divergence within Bromeliaceae has made it difficult to resolve phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily. Although recent molecular studies have begun elucidating relationships among species in Bromeliaceae, most have not sampled deeply and/or broadly across Bromelioideae. The purpose of this study was to conduct a phylogenetic analysis within subfamily Bromelioideae using three chloroplast DNA regions (matK, psbA-trnH, and trnL-trnF), with the inclusion of multiple species from a broad sampling of bromelioid genera. Ochagavia, Deinacanthon, Fascicularia, Bromelia and Fernseea diverged relatively early in the history of the subfamily, with the remaining taxa being placed in a large and poorly resolved eubromelioid clade. Bromelia and Cryptanthus were found to be monophyletic, while 13 other genera were polyphyletic. Aechmea, the most morphologically diverse genus within the subfamily, was highly polyphyletic, with species distributed among 12 different lineages, with little support for subgeneric circumscriptions." ;

Chronologies of the male's two nests, which were 510m apart, were separated by nearly 2 weeks. Each brood initially consisted of three owlets, similar to the mean brood size in monogamous pairs. The male delivered considerably fewer prey to the secondary nest, compared with prey-delivery rates at nests of monogamous males during the nestling period. Evidence suggested that all owlets fledged front the primary brood, but only one fledged front the secondary brood. We were uncertain of the cause of polygyny, but a possible explanation is the Hayman Fire shifted the operational sex ratio of the owls in favor of females. The extent of polygyny in Flammulated Owls may be limited by costs to the reproductive success of secondary females." ;

    schema:about "We took advantage of a high-density seismic array deployed coincident with US Array to study small-magnitude seismicity patterns in northern Wyoming. We detected and located a total of 89 earthquakes ranging in magnitude from -0.5 to 2.4 during the six-month period of April to September 2010. Most events were located shallower than 25 km in the crust, with a few events as deep as 39 km and one very deep earthquake below the Moho, at 63 km. We also detected and recorded 1563 mining explosions in the area. We computed focal mechanism solutions for 14 earthquakes and observed dominantly normal faulting. Stress inversions obtained from these focal mechanisms show extension oriented similar to N20 degrees E that matches borehole breakout data collected in the area. Though wastewater injection wells were active in the region, we see no evidence of induced seismicity in this catalog. The seismicity pattern shows earthquakes occurring beneath areas of high topography in the Bighorn and Owl Creek Mountain ranges. This may indicate a preference to slip on pre-existing weaknesses created during mountain building. The absence of earthquakes between 39 and 63 km depths represents an aseismic zone in the lower crust that may indicate a rheological change between brittle and ductile behavior in the crust, and a strong mantle capable of brittle failure.

    schema:about "The availability of almost 180 cosmogenic-radionuclide (CRN) surface-exposure ages from moraine boulders and glacially polished bedrock surfaces makes possible an assessment of the timing and character of the local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) and subsequent deglaciation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. A review of glacial chronologies and numerical modeling results indicates that although glaciers across Colorado responded broadly synchronously, apparent differences in the timing and magnitude of glacier retreat following the LLGM suggest that spatially variable regional forcing, possibly precipitation related, played a role in glacier behavior along with more spatially uniform hemispheric or global forcing. Glaciers in the five ranges examined reached their greatest LLGM extents before similar to 19.5 ka and abandoned their outermost LLGM moraines between similar to 23.5 and 19.5 ka. Detailed deglaciation chronologies are available for glaciers in four of the ranges. In the Sawatch Range and Sangre de Cristo Mountains, glaciers were near their LLGM extents at 17-16 ka, before retreating rapidly. In the San Juan Mountains and the Front Range, glaciers may have begun their post-LLGM recession earlier, although early deglaciation is indicated by only a few ages on polished bedrock that potentially contains pre-LLGM CRN inheritance, and thus may be too old. Regardless of the timing of the onset of deglaciation, the equilibrium-line rise associated with deglaciation was earlier and significantly larger in the San Juan Mountains than elsewhere in Colorado. This suggests that the San Juan Mountains, located well to the southwest of the other ranges, may have experienced enhanced precipitation during the LLGM, as did areas farther to the south and west, while LLGM conditions may have been drier in the northern and eastern Colorado ranges. A breakdown in this pattern after the LLGM, with precipitation decreasing in the south and west and increasing in the north and east, may have led to the range-to-range differences evident across Colorado. Deglaciation was nearly complete in all four ranges by 15-13 ka. While some proxy records indicate a later Younger Dryas-age cooling in the Colorado mountains, there is not clear moraine evidence of glacier readvance at that time." ;

    schema:about "The stratigraphic record of shallow-water shoreline paleoenvironments is characterized by significant facies heterogeneity and laterally discontinuous stratal geometries. In contrast, we investigate a uniquely extensive and microstratigraphically spatially uniform interval of upper Famennian (Upper Devonian) marginal marine strata in the Rocky Mountains. This transgressive deposit (< 5 m thick) rests on a depositional sequence boundary, and is composed of a thin, discontinuous basal transgressive sandstone bed, two thin fossiliferous shale beds, and several meters of oncolite-bearing carbonate wackestone. The lower shale is a consistently thin (similar to 0.1 m) bed with a fossil fauna of spinicaudatans (clam shrimp or conchostracans), which are extant, bivalved, chitinous, benthic crustaceans that live in fresh to brackish water, in ephemeral ponds, estuaries, and other shoreline settings. Isotopic data for the oncolitic unit record deposition in an epicontinental seaway with restricted circulation and locally brackish conditions. Sulfur isotope data may also reflect short-term changes in redox conditions, consistent with our interpretation of temporary hypoxia during deposition of the spinicaudatan bed, based on its faunal assemblages. The remarkably large areal extent (similar to 1600 km north to south, and similar to 1000 km east to west) of this uniformly thin interval with marginal marine fauna is one of the most unusual paleoecological events of the latest Devonian in Laurentia. It is considered an artifact of exceptional depositional processes including passive transgression (i.e., little or no wave or tidal ravinement) along with rapid opportunistic takeover of habitats during transgression. The radiation, possibly associated with temporary hypoxia, was aided by the spinicaudatan reproductive strategy of numerous offspring, high growth rate, and rapid reproduction." ;

This paper presents empirical evidence from controlled laboratory experiments where third-party decision makers allocate resources between two individuals. The experimental results indicate that subjects view a wide range of different allocations as the fair distribution of resources. However, regression analysis indicates that both treatment effects and a few demographic variables explain some of this variation in fairness concepts. Most significantly, decision makers rewarded subjects who earned their favorable positions, and the gender of the decision maker was an important predictor of the allocation chosen.

Catastrophic floods and associated geomorphic stream channel changes may have contributed to settlement and population changes and the substantial depopulation of the lower Salt River valley ca. A.D. 1450 or later In this study, archaeological data on Hohokam domestic architecture is used to infer changes in prehistoric population growth rates from ca. A.D. 775 through 1450 in the most thoroughly documented canal system in the Salt River valley. Changes in growth rates are compared to the retrodictions of annual streamflow discharge volumes derived from tree-ring records. Contrary to expectations, population growth rates increased as the frequency, magnitude, and duration of inferred flooding, drought, and variability increased. These results challenge existing assumptions regarding the relationship among floods and droughts, conditions for irrigation agriculture, and population change in the lower Salt River valley." ;

    schema:about "This essay makes the case that one of the most significant errors in aesthetic theory is its failure to account for art as a creative act that emerges from the temporal flow of lived experience. Drawing on John Dewey's aesthetics and contemporary poetics, it articulates a view of creative action in terms of temporal experience. It begins by showing why time must be considered central to aesthetic theory, drawing a connection between time and what Dewey calls the logic of qualitative thought. It then distinguishes between time as a temporal ordering and time as a temporal quality of creative action. Finally, it argues that creative action is only possible because it is a temporally emergent process that is qualitatively experienced. As a result of placing temporality at its core, aesthetic theory shifts from a concern with the products of the art world to the practices of creative action." ;

It figures centrally in Krull's classical construction of valued fields with pre-described value groups, and plays a crucial role in our new short proof of the Ohm-Jaffard-Kaplansky theorem on Bezout domains with given lattice-ordered abelian groups. Furthermore, Eisenstein's criterion on the irreducibility of polynomials as well as Chao's beautiful extension of Eisenstein's criterion over arbitrary domains, in particular over Dedekind domains, are also obvious consequences of Gauss' lemma. We conclude with a new result which provides a Gauss' lemma for Hermite rings." ;

    schema:about "Populations of Impatiens capensis can differentiate across a range of soil moisture conditions. Differences in the plasticity of drought response at both the physiological and morphological level have been documented in populations across the North American range of this species. Impatiens populations tend to utilize whichever drought response mechanism will be most helpful in ensuring their survival and persistence in their particular environment. Here, we examine whether populations from a range of moisture environments exhibit tolerance/avoidance strategies in early life-history and whether maternal effects are important to seedling stress responses. Populations from Pennsylvania across a range of three moisture conditions all responded to maternal drought by decreasing stomatal conductance in seedlings; this maternal drought response was ephemeral and only observed during the first few weeks of growth. Moreover, abscisic acid content covaried with this conductance plasticity for two of the three populations. For the population with the greatest amount of soil moisture, abscisic acid sensitivity seemed to be more important for maternal drought response." ;

    schema:about "Recognition of a right of resistance to oppression clearly helped modern Western polities accept constitutional forms of order. Drawing on Locke's canonical discussion in the Second Treatise, influential Anglo-American political theorists also suggest that the establishment of modern constitutional states required outlawing resistance practices. A francophone perspective, however, raises a problem for such generalizations about modern Western political philosophy and practice: the French \"resistance\" differs in meaning from the English \"resistance\" in important ways. Reconstructing the histories of the cognate concepts, I show that \"resistance\" emerged out of feminized discourses concerning moral conscience and that, as a result, excluding resistance from politics seems implausible, a conclusion that sheds light on the discussion of resistance in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. The article closes with the suggestion that, following the Second World War, French understandings of \"resistance\" may have influenced American politics and thought in unrecognized ways." ;

    schema:about "This article draws on Lacanian theory in order to analyse the role of technology in the constitution of posthuman subjects. It does so by focussing firstly on those aspects of Lacan's teachings that engage with science and technology, particularly the concept of the 'alethosphere' developed in Seminar XVII, which refers to an environment of gadgets that plug directly into human desire. The article then goes on to apply this notion of the 'alethosphere' to a key technological, cultural and also political example: the interactive, touch-screen electoral maps made popular during the 2008 American election. Through a close analysis of one use of such maps during a CNN broadcast, the author demonstrates both the essential meaninglessness of this technology, and the support it nonetheless provides to the search for meaning, in the form of a unified American national subject emerging consensually from the spectacle of the process of democracy.

    schema:about "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human.-herpesvirus that establishes latency and lifelong infection in host B cells while achieving a balance with the host immune response. When the immune system is perturbed through immunosuppression or immunodeficiency, however, these latently infected B cells can give rise to aggressive B cell lymphomas. Natural killer (NK) cells are regarded as critical in the early immune response to viral infection, but their role in controlling expansion of infected B cells is not understood. Here, we report that NK cells from healthy human donors display increased killing of autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) harboring latent EBV compared to primary B cells. Coculture of NK cells with autologous EBV+ LCL identifies an NK cell population that produces IFN gamma and mobilizes the cytotoxic granule protein CD107a. Multi-parameter flow cytometry and Boolean analysis reveal that these functional cells are enriched for expression of the NK cell receptor NKG2A. Further, NKG2A(+) NK cells more efficiently lyse autologous LCL than do NKG2A(-) NK cells. More specifically, NKG2A(+) 2B4(+) CD16(-)CD57(-)NKG2C(-)NKG2D(+) cells constitute the predominant NK cell population that responds to latently infected autologous EBV+ B cells. Thus, a subset of NK cells is enhanced for the ability to recognize and eliminate autologous, EBV-infected transformed cells, laying the groundwork for harnessing this subset for therapeutic use in EBV+ malignancies." ;

    schema:about "Williams syndrome (WS) is a unique neurodevelopmental disorder with a specific behavioral and cognitive profile, which includes hyperaffiliative behavior, poor social judgment, and lack of social inhibition. Here we examined the morphology of basal dendrites on pyramidal neurons in the cortex of two rare adult subjects with WS. Specifically, we examined two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) - the frontal pole (Brodmann area 10) and the orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann area 11) - and three areas in the motor, sensory, and visual cortex (BA 4, BA 3-1-2, BA 18). The findings suggest that the morphology of basal dendrites on the pyramidal neurons is altered in the cortex of WS, with differences that were layer-specific, more prominent in PFC areas, and displayed an overall pattern of dendritic organization that differentiates WS from other disorders. In particular, and unlike what was expected based on typically developing brains, basal dendrites in the two PFC areas did not display longer and more branched dendrites compared to motor, sensory and visual areas. Moreover, dendritic branching, dendritic length, and the number of dendritic spines differed little within PFC and between the central executive region (BA 10) and BA 11 that is part of the orbitofrontal region involved into emotional processing. In contrast, the relationship between the degree of neuronal branching in supra-versus infra-granular layers was spared in WS. Although this study utilized tissue held in formalin for a prolonged period of time and the number of neurons available for analysis was limited, our findings indicate that WS cortex, similar to that in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, Fragile X, and idiopathic autism, has altered morphology of basal dendrites on pyramidal neurons, which appears more prominent in selected areas of the PFC. Results were examined from developmental perspectives and discussed in the context of other neurodevelopmental disorders. We have proposed hypotheses for further investigations of morphological changes on basal dendrites in WS, a syndrome of particular interest given its unique social and cognitive phenotype." ;

    schema:about "Within the last century, the floristic composition of riparian communities in the Southwest has drastically changed following introduction of the exotic tree Tamarix ramosissima. In an attempt to control Tamarix populations, the tamarisk leaf beetle ( Diorhabda carinulata) has been utilized as a biological control agent. Three years of data collection at our study sites along Fountain Creek (Fountain, CO) allowed us to characterize the response of Tamarix to invasion by the biological control agent. In analyzing data collected before, during, and after the beetle invasion, we observed a significant effect of foliar herbivory on Tamarix physiology and life history strategy. Associations between flower number and functional traits changed before, during, and after the beetle invasion. Before the invasion, reproductively fit individuals exhibited high stomatal conductance and used relatively more water. During and after the invasion, fit plants had higher foliar chlorophyll content, but conductance was not significantly correlated with fecundity. Tamarix responded to defoliation by increasing water use, which may have been an attempt to sustain photosynthate allocation to reproductive structures. Therefore, the leaf beetle may increase the water use of Tamarix during the growing season.

En un intento por controlar las poblaciones de Tamarix, se ha utilizado al escarabajo de la hoja de tamariscos ( Diorhabda carinulata) como control biolÃ³gico. La colecta de datos durante tres aÃ±os en nuestras Ã¡reas de estudio a lo largo de Fountain Creek (Fountain, Colorado) nos permitiÃ³ caracterizar la respuesta de Tamarix a la invasiÃ³n del agente de control biolÃ³gico. Al analizar los datos obtenidos antes, durante y despuÃ©s de la invasiÃ³n del escarabajo, observamos un efecto significativo de la herbivorÃ­a foliar en la fisiologÃ­a y la estrategia de historia de vida de Tamarix. Las asociaciones entre el nÃºmero de flores y los rasgos funcionales se modificaron antes, durante y despuÃ©s de la invasiÃ³n de escarabajos. Antes de la invasiÃ³n, los individuos reproductivamente aptos mostraban en los estomas una conductancia elevada y utilizaban relativamente mÃ¡s agua. Durante y despuÃ©s de la invasiÃ³n, las plantas sanas mostraron un mayor contenido de clorofila foliar, pero la conductancia no se correlacionÃ³ significativamente con la fecundidad. El Tamarix respondiÃ³ a la defoliaciÃ³n mediante el aumento en el uso de agua, lo que pudo ser un intento para mantener la asignaciÃ³n de fotosintatos a las estructuras reproductivas. Por lo tanto, el escarabajo puede aumentar el uso del agua de Tamarix durante su estaciÃ³n de crecimiento.

    schema:about "Puya (Bromeliaceae), a large genus of terrestrial bromeliads found throughout a range of elevations in the Andes and central Chile, is of great systematic, evolutionary, and biogeographical interest. This first molecular phylogenetic study of Puya and related bromeliads employs matK, trnS-trnG, rps16, and PHYC sequences. Chloroplast DNA, nuclear DNA, and combined DNA data all place Puya closest to subfamily Bromelioideae. Nuclear and combined data support Puya as monophyletic, and the two subgenera are nonmonophyletic. All data indicate that the Chilean species of Puya are early diverging within the genus, consistent with Chilean genera as the first-diverging members of subfamily Bromelioideae. Central Chile is identified as a key region for understanding the biogeographical history of Bromeliaceae, as is true with other South American plant groups. A complicated history involving early chloroplast capture and later secondary hybridization and/or introgression is seen in Chilean lineages. These events help explain the occurrence of sterile inflorescence tips, floral color and shape, and leaf indument. The ecological radiation of Puya appears coincident with the final, recent rise of the Andes and subsequent high-elevation habitat diversification. Additionally, geographical distribution, rather than moisture or elevational adaptations, correlates to species relationships. Evolution of CAM photosynthesis has occurred multiple times." ;

    schema:about ". Premise : Bromeliaceae form a large, ecologically diverse family of angiosperms native to the New World. We use a bromeliad phylogeny based on eight plastid regions to analyze relationships within the family, test a new, eight-subfamily classification, infer the chronology of bromeliad evolution and invasion of different regions, and provide the basis for future analyses of trait evolution and rates of diversification. . Methods : We employed maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian approaches to analyze 9341 aligned bases for four outgroups and 90 bromeliad species representing 46 of 58 described genera. We calibrate the resulting phylogeny against time using penalized likelihood applied to a monocot-wide tree based on plastid ndhF sequences and use it to analyze patterns of geographic spread using parsimony, Bayesian inference, and the program S-DIVA. . Results : Bromeliad subfamilies are related to each other as follows: (Brocchinioideae, (Lindmanioideae, (Tillandsioideae, (Hechtioideae, (Navioideae, (Pitcairnioideae, (Puyoideae, Bromelioideae))))))). Bromeliads arose in the Guayana Shield ca. 100 million years ago (Ma), spread centrifugally in the New World beginning ca. 16-13 Ma, and dispersed to West Africa ca. 9.3 Ma. Modern lineages began to diverge from each other roughly 19 Ma. . Conclusions : Nearly two-thirds of extant bromeliads belong to two large radiations: the core tillandsioids, originating in the Andes ca. 14.2 Ma, and the Brazilian Shield bromelioids, originating in the Serro do Mar and adjacent regions ca. 9.1 Ma." ;

    schema:about "The evolution of the inflorescence head in Asteraceae is important in the diversification of this largest angiosperm family. The aggregation of heads into higher-order capitulescences (secondary heads or syncephalia) is considered evolutionarily advanced. The genera Moscharia, Nassauvia, Polyachyrus, and Triptilion of the subtribe Nassauviinae (Mutisieae) have syncephalia with differing degrees of capitula condensation. ITS and plastid trnL-trnF regions were analyzed separately and together using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood to examine the evolution of syncephalia in the Nassauviinae. The four genera displaying syncephalia do not form a clade minus taxa without syncephalia, indicating that secondary heads in Nassauviinae have either convergently evolved twice in the subtribe (or, very unlikely) once with multiple reversions. Strong support was obtained for a sister relationship between Leucheria (without syncephalium) and Polyachyrus, and both sister to Moscharia. Nassauvia and Triptilion form a distinct clade but are sister to other genera, Perezia and Panphalea, without syncephalium. Previous hypotheses postulated the evolution from simple to more complex secondary heads. We show that the ancestor of Moscharia, Polyachyrus, and Leucheria, in a more and habitat, had a complex type of secondary head, and loss of complexity occurred in response to a shift from and to mesic conditions." ;

    schema:about "We used a novel task: a blackjack game that naturally involves mental summation of numerical values to investigate the role of attention in the mental number line (MNL) and to provide insight into the ecological validity of this representational format. By analyzing the spatial position of participants' spontaneous, task-irrelevant eye movements, we avoided some of the limitations of previous research on the MNL, in which the findings could be attributed to task-specific factors such as the use of overt spatial cues. In two experiments, we found that eye movements along the horizontal axis reflected the overall numerical value of participants' hands, with smaller-value hands eliciting fixations toward the left of the screen and larger-value hands eliciting fixations toward the right. This pattern held even when controlling for the number of cards in the hand and the value of the card most recently dealt, suggesting that the effects were driven by mental summation of values, not merely by the processing of serial order or individual numbers. Vertical eye movements, in contrast, reflected hand value less reliably. In showing that spontaneous eye movements along the horizontal axis track the magnitude of internally computed sums in an ecologically relevant task, our findings provide evidence for a dynamic MNL that supports magnitude-driven shifts of attention and that may be recruited during everyday forms of numerical reasoning.

    schema:about "The spatial relation of support has been regarded as universally privileged in nonlinguistic cognition and immune to the influence of language. English, but not Korean, obligatorily distinguishes support from nonsupport via basic spatial terms. Despite this linguistic difference, previous research suggests that English and Korean speakers show comparable nonlinguistic sensitivity to the support/nonsupport distinction. Here, using a paradigm previously found to elicit cross-language differences in color discrimination, we provide evidence for a difference in sensitivity to support/nonsupport between native English speakers and native Korean speakers who were late English learners and tested in a context that privileged Korean. Whereas the former group showed categorical perception (CP) when discriminating spatial scenes capturing the support/nonsupport distinction, the latter did not. An additional group of native Korean speakers -- relatively early English learners tested in an English-salient context -- patterned with the native English speakers in showing CP for support/nonsupport. These findings suggest that obligatory marking of support/nonsupport in one's native language can affect nonlinguistic sensitivity to this distinction, contra earlier findings, but that such sensitivity may also depend on aspects of language background and the immediate linguistic context.

    schema:about "For sufficiently wide orbital separations a, the two members of a stellar binary evolve independently. This implies that in a wide double white dwarf (DWD), the more massive WD should always be produced first, when its more massive progenitor ends its main sequence (MS) life, and should therefore be older and cooler than its companion. The bound, wide DWD HS 2220+2146 ( au) does not conform to this picture: the more massive WD is the younger and hotter of the pair. We show that this discrepancy is unlikely to be due to past mass-transfer phases or to the presence of an unresolved companion. Instead, we propose that HS 2220+2146 formed through a new wide DWD evolutionary channel involving the merger of the inner binary in a hierarchical triple system. The resulting blue straggler and its wide companion then evolved independently, forming the WD pair seen today. Although we cannot rule out other scenarios, the most likely formation channel has the inner binary merging while both stars are still on the MS. This provides us with the tantalizing possibility that Kozaiâ€“Lidov oscillations may have played a role in the inner binaryâ€™s merger. Gaia may uncover hundreds more wide DWDs, leading to the identification of other systems like HS 2220+2146. There are already indications that other WD systems may have been formed through different, but related, hierarchical triple evolutionary scenarios. Characterizing these populations may allow for thorough testing of the efficiency with which Kozaiâ€“Lidov oscillations induce stellar mergers.

J200520.38+542433.9 (Wolf 1130C), which has a proper motion in common with a binary (Wolf 1130AB) consisting of an M subdwarf and a white dwarf, we set out to learn more about the old binary in the system. We find that the A and B components of Wolf 1130 are tidally locked, which is revealed by the coherence of more than a year of V-band photometry phase-folded to the derived orbital period of 0.4967 days. Forty new high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer provide radial velocities and a projected rotational velocity (v sin i) of 14.7 +/- 0.7 km s(-1) for the M subdwarf. In tandem with a Gaia parallax-derived radius and verified tidal locking, we calculate an inclination of i = 29 degrees +/- 2 degrees. From the single-lined orbital solution and the inclination we derive an absolute mass for the unseen primary (1.24(-0.15)(+0.19) M-circle dot). Its non-detection between 0.2 and 2.5 mu m implies that it is an old (>3.7 Gyr) and cool (T-eff 100 times the tertiary mass and the survival of the system through the common-envelope phase, where similar to 80% of the system mass was lost, is remarkable.

    schema:about "We collected mercury observations as part of the Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) aircraft campaign over the southeastern US between 1 June and 15 July 2013. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to interpret these observations and place new constraints on bromine radical initiated mercury oxidation chemistry in the free troposphere. We find that the model reproduces the observed mean concentration of total atmospheric mercury (THg) (observations: 1.49 +/- 0.16 ngm(-3), model: 1.51 +/- 0.08 ngm(-3)), as well as the vertical profile of THg. The majority (65 %) of observations of oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) were below the instrument's detection limit (detection limit per flight: 58-228 pgm(-3)), consistent with model-calculated Hg(II) concentrations of 0-196 pgm(-3). However, for observations above the detection limit we find that modeled Hg(II) concentrations are a factor of 3 too low (observations: 212 +/- 112 pgm-3, model: 67 +/- 44 pgm(-3)). The high-est Hg(II) concentrations, 300-680 pgm(-3), were observed in dry (RH < 35 %) and clean air masses during two flights over Texas at 5-7 km altitude and off the North Carolina coast at 1-3 km. The GEOS-Chem model, back trajectories and observed chemical tracers for these air masses indicate subsidence and transport from the upper and middle troposphere of the subtropical anticyclones, where fast oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) to Hg(II) and lack of Hg(II) removal lead to efficient accumulation of Hg(II). We hypothesize that the most likely explanation for the model bias is a systematic underestimate of the Hg(0) + Br reaction rate. We find that sensitivity simulations with tripled bromine radical concentrations or a faster oxidation rate constant for Hg(0) + Br, result in 1.5-2 times higher modeled Hg(II) concentrations and improved agreement with the observations. The modeled tropospheric lifetime of Hg(0) against oxidation to Hg(II) decreases from 5 months in the base simulation to 2.8-1.2 months in our sensitivity simulations. In order to maintain the modeled global burden of THg, we need to increase the in-cloud reduction of Hg(II), thus leading to faster chemical cycling between Hg(0) and Hg(II). Observations and model results for the NOMADSS campaign suggest that the subtropical anticyclones are significant global sources of Hg(II)." ;

    schema:about "Atmospheric chemistry and transport of mercury play a key role in the global mercury cycle. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps concerning the fate of mercury in the atmosphere. This is the second part of a model intercomparison study investigating the impact of atmospheric chemistry and emissions on mercury in the atmosphere. While the first study focused on ground-based observations of mercury concentration and deposition, here we investigate the vertical and interhemispheric distribution and speciation of mercury from the planetary boundary layer to the lower stratosphere. So far, there have been few model studies investigating the vertical distribution of mercury, mostly focusing on single aircraft campaigns. Here, we present a first comprehensive analysis based on various aircraft observations in Europe, North America, and on intercontinental flights. The investigated models proved to be able to reproduce the distribution of total and elemental mercury concentrations in the troposphere including interhemispheric trends. One key aspect of the study is the investigation of mercury oxidation in the troposphere.

    schema:about "Atmospheric chemistry and transport of mercury play a key role in the global mercury cycle. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps concerning the fate of mercury in the atmosphere. This is the second part of a model inter-comparison study investigating the impact of atmospheric chemistry and emissions on mercury in the atmosphere. While the first study focused on ground based observations of mercury concentration and deposition, here we investigate the vertical distribution and speciation of mercury from the planetary boundary layer to the lower stratosphere. So far, there have been few model studies investigating the vertical distribution of mercury, mostly focusing on single aircraft campaigns. Here, we present a first comprehensive analysis based on various aircraft observations in Europe, North America, and on inter-continental flights. The investigated models proved to be able to reproduce the distribution of total and elemental mercury concentrations in the troposphere including inter-hemispheric trends. One key aspect of the study is the investigation of mercury oxidation in the troposphere. We found that different chemistry schemes were better at reproducing observed oxidized mercury (RM) patterns depending on altitude. High RM concentrations in the upper troposphere could be reproduced with oxidation by bromine while elevated concentrations in the lower troposphere were better reproduced by OH and ozone chemistry. However, the results were not always conclusive as the physical and chemical parametrizations in the chemistry transport models also proved to have a substantial impact on model results.

    schema:about "Traditionally, there has been a large gap between the scientific and educational communities in terms of communication, which hinders the transfer of new scientific knowledge to teachers and students and the understanding of each other's needs and capabilities. In this paper, we describe a workshop model we have developed to facilitate communication, enriching and enlightening those immediately involved and can be successfully implemented as part of any outreach activity, whether the scientific/technical or educational community initiates it. The workshop model is composed of preworkshop, workshop, and postworkshop elements that strategically scaffold the participants' experience through extended cross-community breakout and networking time. This model has enabled deeper understanding in each community of the other's needs, and in many cases has resulted in a concrete outcome in the form of an online Earth Exploration Toolbook chapter that can be used effectively in educational contexts beyond the workshop participants.

    schema:about "Access to geoscience data has been difficult for many educators. Understanding what educators want in terms of data has been equally difficult for scientists. From 2004 to 2009, we conducted annual workshops that brought together scientists, data providers, data analysis tool specialists, educators, and curriculum developers to better understand data use, access, and user-community needs. All users desired more access to data that provide an opportunity to conduct queries, as well as visual/graphical displays on geoscience data without the barriers presented by specialized data formats or software knowledge. Presented here is a framework for examining data access from a workflow perspective, a redefinition of data not as products but as learning opportunities, and finally, results from a Data Use Survey collected during six workshops that indicate a preference for easy-to-obtain data that allow users to graph, map, and recognize patterns using educationally familiar tools (e.g., Excel and Google Earth)." ;

    schema:about "Discussions of the concept of authenticity often fail to define the conditions of an appropriate emotional orientation toward the world. With a more solid philosophical understanding of emotion, it should be possible to define more precisely the necessary conditions of emotional authenticity. Against this background, I interpret Kierkegaard's Either/Or as a narrative text that suggests a moral psychology of emotion that points toward the development of a better way of thinking about the ethics of authenticity. In the process, I also engage with the positions of other philosophers, both \"existential\" and \"analytic.\" The upshot of my argument is that a cognitive phenomenology of emotion can flesh out the ideal of truthfulness as a virtue of character, while forcing moral philosophers to question whether authenticity should be understood as an achievement of the will rather than as a matter of affective receptivity." ;

    schema:about "Biopharmaceutical research and development is overwhelmingly focused in the U.S. because here it is incentivized and encouraged through a robust intellectual property rights protection environment. Across the board, the United States provides the most comprehensive, effective intellectual property rights protections for biopharmaceuticals. As a result, the industry locates here, researches here and thrives here. With an acknowledgement of the importance of intellectual property rights as well as the wider benefits of biopharmaceutical research and development, it's tremendously disappointing that the recently negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Trade Agreement fails to deliver sufficient IP protection for biologics. This article explores the importance of a rigorous intellectual property environment for the biopharmaceutical industry through an examination of the importance of data exclusivity provisions. Such protection is critical as the number, complexity and cost of clinical trials increases. Technology inevitably evolves faster than the legal architecture that surrounds it. As technology evolves, making the development of new biologic vaccines and therapies possible, society's commitment to incentivize innovation and protect it must be enshrined in the intellectual property protections of agreements such as the TPP.

    schema:about "Combining calibrated hydrophone measurements with vessel location data from the Automatic Identification System, we estimate underwater sound pressure levels for 1,582 unique ships that transited the core critical habitat of the endangered Southern Resident killer whales during 28 months between march, 2011, and octoher, 2011 Median received spectrum levels of noise from 2,809 isolated transits are elevated relative to median background levels not only at low frequencies (20-30 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz from 100 to 1,000 Hz), but also at high frequencies (5-13 dB from 10 000 t 96,000 Hz) frequencies used by odontocetes. Broadband received levels (11.5-40,000 Hz) near the shoreline in Haro Strait (WA, USA) for the entire ship population were 110 +/- 7 dB mu Pa-2 on average. Assuming near-spberieal spreading based on a tranSm1SS1On loss expenment we compute mean broadband source levels for the ship population of 173 + 7 dB re 1 tiPa 1 m without accounting for frequency-dependent absorption. Mean ship speed was 73 + m/s 14.1 + 3.9 knots). Most ship classes show a linear relationship between source level and speed with a slope near +2 dB per m/s (+1 dB/knot). Spectrum, 1/12-octave, and 1/3-octave source levels for the whole population have median values that are comparable to previous measurements and models at most frequencies, but for select studies may be relatively low below 200 Hz and high above 20,000 Hz. Median source spectrum levels peak near 50 Hz for all 12 ship classes, have a maximum of 159 dB re 1 it mu Pa-2/Hz @ 1 m for container ships, and vary between classes. Below 200 Hz, the class-specific median spectrum levels bifurcate with large commercial ships grouping as higher power noise sources. Within all ship classes spectrum levels vary more at low frequencies than at high frequencies, and the degree of variability is almost halved for classes that have smaller speed standard deviations. This is the first study to present source spectra for populations of different ship classes operating in coastal habitats, including at higher frequencies used by killer whales for both communication and echolocation." ;

    schema:about "\"On-off\" phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD) are unpredictable motor fluctuations associated with long-term levodopa use. Mood fluctuations have been found to coincide with the motor fluctuations in that depression and anxiety increase while the person with PD is in the \"off\" state. What has been relatively unexplored is whether those persons with PD who have \"on-off\" phenomena differ psychologically in fundamental ways from those who do not have \"on-off\" phenomena. In the present study, depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed in 36 persons with PD (n = 14 with \"on-off\" phenomena, n = 22 without \"on-off\" phenomena). All those with \"on-off\" phenomena were assessed in their \"on\" state. Those persons with PD with \"on-off\" phenomena had significantly higher levels of anxiety than those without \"on-off\" phenomena. However, both groups, regardless of \"on-off\" status, were mildly depressed. Neurobiological interpretations of the results implicate the locus coeruleus in the pathogenesis of both \"on-off\" phenomena and anxiety, whereas psychological interpretations of the results involve the issues of learned helplessness and control over health symptoms in PD." ;

    schema:about "We estimated annual return rate, fidelity, and breeding dispersal in a migratory population of Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) in central Colorado. Return rates, based on capture-recapture histories of 39 males and 52 females from 1981 to 2003, were higher for males (84%) than for females (45%). Annual recapture probability was higher for females, because breeders are easier to capture than nonbreeders and females always attempted to nest, whereas some males were unpaired (did not nest) for up to four years. Territory fidelity was male biased (92%, vs. 56% for females, adjusted for undetected emigration), and mean tenure on territories was more than twice as long for males as for females. Females, but not males, had lower return rates to territories in the year following nesting failure compared with females whose nests were successful. Most males appeared to occupy one territory their entire reproductive lives, countering predictions of habitat-selection models that individuals should move to higher-quality habitats when they become available. We estimated that 74% of pairs retained the same mate in consecutive nesting attempts, but mates that bred together for multiple years had no reproductive advantages over mates that bred together for the first time. In most cases, females dispersed from territories if their mates did not return. When females dispersed, they went to territories where total productivity over the study and lifetime reproductive success of new mates were higher than on original territories, which supports the hypothesis that dispersal by females increases individual fitness." ;

The depth and systematic character of Rousseau's thought was recognized almost immediately by thinkers such as Kant and Hegel, yet debate continues over the degree to which Rousseau's legacy is the result of poetic, literary, or rhetorical genius, rather than of philosophic rigor or profundity. The authors focus on Rousseau's genuine yet undervalued stature as a philosopher. This collection includes essays that develop some of the complex problems Rousseau treated so radically and profoundly, as well as essays on the vigorous debates he engaged in with thoughtful contemporaries and predecessors\"-- Provided by publisher; Includes bibliographical references and index; Introduction / Eve Grace and Christopher Kelly -- Part I. Politics and Economics: 1. Rousseau and the illustrious Montesquieu / Christopher Kelly; 2. Political economy and individual liberty / Ryan Patrick Hanley -- Part II. Science and Epistemology: 3.

    bf:Summary "\"An exploration of how doctors and social scientists in Fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle France and Italy explained crime, vagrancy, perversion, insanity, neurosis and genius\"-- Provided by publisher; \"As the 19th century drew to a close, France and Italy experienced an explosion of crime, vagrancy, insanity, neurosis and sexual deviance. 'Misfits' in Fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle France and Italy examines how the raft of self-appointed experts that subsequently emerged tried to explain this aberrant behavior and the many consequences this had. Susan Ashley considers why these different phenomena were understood to be interchangeable versions of the same inborn defects. The book looks at why specialists in newly -minted disciplines in medicine and the social sciences, such as criminology, neurology and sexology, all claimed that biological flaws--some inherited and some arising from illness or trauma--made it impossible for these 'misfits' to adapt to modern life. Ashley then goes on to analyse the solutions these specialists proposed, often distinguishing between born deviants who belonged in asylums or prisons and 'accidental misfits' who deserved solidarity and social support through changes to laws relating to issues like poverty and unemployment. The study draws on a comprehensive examination of contemporary texts and features the work of leading authorities like Cesare Lombroso, Jean-Martin Charcot, and ThÃƒÂ©odule Ribot, as well as investigators less known now but influential at the time. The comparative aspect also interestingly shows that experts collaborated closely across national and disciplinary borders, employed similar methods and arrived at common conclusions. This is a valuable study for all social and cultural historians of France and Italy and anyone interested in knowing more about the history of medicine in modern Europe\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "\"One method of American territory expansion in the U.S.- Mexico borderlands was the denial of property rights to Mexican land owners. Many historical accounts overlook this colonial impact on Indigenous and Mexican peoples, and what existing studies do tackle this subject tend to privilege the male experience. In Archives of Dispossession, Karen Roybal recenters the focus of land dispossession on women, arguing that gender, sometimes more than race, dictated legal concepts of property ownership and individual autonomy. Drawing on a diverse source base - legal land records, personal letters, and literary works - Roybal reveals voices of Mexican women in the Southwest and how they fought against the erasure of their rights, both as women and as Indigenous landowners. Woven throughout Roybal's analysis are these women's testimonies - their stories focusing on inheritance, property rights, and sovereignty. Roybal positions these testimonios as an alternate archive that illustrates the myriad ways in which multiple layers of dispossession - and the changes of property ownership in Mexican law - affected the formation of Mexicana identity\"-- Provided by publisher"@en ;

    bf:Summary "This edited collection brings together a robust range of philosophers who offer theoretically and critically informed proposals regarding the aims, policies, and structures of the university. The collection fills a major gap in the landscape of higher education theory and practice while concurrently reviving a long and often forgotten discourse within the discipline of philosophy. It includes philosophers from across the globe representing disparate philosophical schools, as well as various career stages, statuses, and standpoints within the university. There is also a diversity in method, approach and style, which varies from personal narratives and case studies, to philosophical genealogies, to traditional philosophical essays, and to systematic theories. The collection can serve as a theoretical resource for critically minded administrators and faculty who wish to analyze and change policies and structures at their home institutions. It will introduce them to a wide range of possible educational imaginaries, as well as provide them with productive suggestions for pragmatic change on campuses.Ã‚Â"@en ;
